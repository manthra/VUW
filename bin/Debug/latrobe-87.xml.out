<p><hi rend="c">Melbourne May Not</hi> always have been as marvellous as it likes to think &#x2013; but it has always been multifarious. When I was invited to edit this special issue of the <hi rend="i">La Trobe Journal</hi> I saw it as a way not merely to showcase the work that gay and lesbian historians have been doing over recent years, but also as a way of encouraging people &#x2013; all of us &#x2013; to look at our city's history differently.</p>
<p>The queer history of Melbourne is, in part, the history of a minority. But is also the history of the city itself, examined from an unexpected angle. Iconic places look very different when seen through the eyes of queer folk. Take the cover image of this volume. The Queen Victoria Hospital was a well-known example of Melbourne's proud civic architecture, of feminist activism, of a society that strove to take care of its weaker members. But for some of us, the public toilet sitting inconspicuously on the corner of Swanston and Lonsdale will have its own story to tell &#x2013; for many decades it was one of the city's most active pickup places for camp/gay/queer men.</p>
<p>Archives, remembrance, experience, reflection bring new insights to our knowledge and understanding of Melbourne's history. And in most cases, it is through combinations of these ways of doing history that we get such striking stories and deep insights.</p>
<p>The articles in this volume bring to light a history that will be new to many readers. And they do so in a variety of ways. We have memoir (Michael Hurley reflects upon his arrival in Melbourne in the mid-<date value="1970">1970s</date>) and an interview with Haddon Storey, the state Attorney-General who in the late seventies introduced legislation into the Victorian Parliament that decriminalised homosexual acts between men.</p>
<p>Barrett Reid, a long-time senior staff member of the State Library of Victoria, is shown in a new light in an article that shows evidence of both research and personal knowledge. Grand edifices like the old Hotel Australia in Collins Street and the statue of St George on the forecourt of the Library, and a small photo album held by the Library's Pictures Collection, offer very different ways of exploring the city's past. Rennie Ellis' photos are worth many thousands of words. There are articles that reveal the fruits of longterm detailed research. Wayne Murdoch's article is drawn from many hours immersed in the court records of the <date value="1920">1920s</date> and thirties. The left, and youth &#x2013; both aspects of gay and lesbian life that have tended to be overlooked in the past &#x2013; here get some much needed attention. There are reflections, too, on how to do this new and emerging history &#x2013; what sources exist and how do we make sense of them? The bibliography gives some idea of how much has been done already &#x2013; and this is only the short version.</p>
<p>For a long time, researching and writing gay history was confined very largely to the painstaking accumulation of basic source materials. This remains a major task and also a richly rewarding one. But we have reached a point now where debates about the past have become possible. The rather different views that Kate Davison and Bev Roberts have on Miss Drysdale and Miss Newcomb involve questions of identity, but also involve
<pb xml:id="n3" n="3"/>
quite different attitudes to who or what this history is all about. 'Were they or weren't they?' by no means exhausts the scope of debates and discussions about our past.</p>
<p>And finally, a note on terminology. Gay and lesbian history has long been bedevilled by the problem of 'what to call them?' Over the years same-sex desire has been labelled in a variety of ways &#x2013; from the religiously-inflected <hi rend="i">sodomite</hi>, to the medically-inspired Greco-Latin <hi rend="i">homosexual</hi>, and the vernacular <hi rend="i">poofter</hi> and <hi rend="i">lezzo</hi> . . . Beginning in the <date value="1970">1970s</date> we began to speak for ourselves, but, far from simplifying matters, this made the situation even more confusing &#x2013; <hi rend="i">camp, gay, lesbian, queer</hi> all competed. Other groups started to speak up and demand inclusion &#x2013; bisexuals, transsexuals, transgender and intersex people . . . <hi rend="i">Same-sex attracted</hi> was applied to young people; men <hi rend="i">who have sex with men</hi> to another group entirely. There is no right answer and in this volume we have left the authors to use their own preferred terms.</p>

<p><hi rend="c">The Writing of Australia's</hi> gay and lesbian history begins in <date value="1977">1977</date> when Martin Smith, a Sydney gay activist, started publishing a series of articles on the early years of the British colony in <hi rend="i">Campaign</hi>, the national gay newspaper. In twelve instalments, based on his research using manuscripts, letters and colonial newspapers, he revealed a homosexual history of quite remarkable richness and complexity embracing prominent individuals and a thriving, if hidden, homosexual underworld.<note xml:id="fn1-87" n="1"><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi>Martin Smith, Twelve part history series, <hi rend="i">Campaign</hi>, <date value="1977-04">April 1977</date>-<date value="1978-03">March 1978</date>.</p></note> It is true that Smith read too much into some of his evidence &#x2013; detecting, for example, homosexuality where others might only detect the flowery language of the time. And he displayed little sensitivity to the ways in which sexual categories are time-specific. For Smith, homosexuality was homosexuality, pretty much regardless of time and place and, for him, all historians needed to do was to unearth it. These flaws, while important, seemed minor in comparison to the magnitude of his achievement.</p>
<p>Except, as it turned out, the problem with Smith's work wasn't that he misread his sources; it was that he simply made many of them up. As Robert French found, when he went to examine for himself the various citations that littered the articles, many of them could not be located.<note xml:id="fn2-87" n="2"><p><hi rend="sup">2</hi>Robert French, <hi rend="i">Camping By a Billabong: gay and lesbian stories from Australian History</hi>, Sydney: Blackwattle Press, <date value="1993">1993</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>This rather disappointing start to Australian gay history writing is a stark reminder that the internet is not the only place where dodgy information lurks, waiting to trip us up. And it did have one positive outcome &#x2013; having discovered the problems with Smith's work, Robert French went on to write a series of his own; meticulously researched, sources clearly spelled out &#x2013; and no less lively than Smith's tales. Published first in a gay newspaper in <date value="1992">1992</date> and <date value="1993">1993</date>, they were eventually collected as <hi rend="i">Camping by a Billabong</hi> by the community-based publisher Blackwattle Press. The volume &#x2013; now long out of print &#x2013; remains a model for the writing of community-based and community-oriented history.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to explore that kind of history writing, to consider the ways in which <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history has always been, to a very large extent, community-focused. This is partly a matter of necessity, but it is not, in any significant way, a disadvantage or a failing. On the contrary, I want to suggest that this orientation has been a source of considerable strength and innovation for the field and that academic scholarship might well look to this field for inspiration and models for its own work. This is not an issue that has been much discussed in any formal way, although Garry Wotherspoon offered an important exploration of the issues as early as <date value="1992">1992</date>.<note xml:id="fn3-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi>Garry Wotherspoon, 'From Private Vice to Public History: Homosexuality in Australia', <hi rend="i">Public History Review</hi>, vol. 1, <date value="1992">1992</date>, pp. 148-159.</p></note> This article aims to take the discussion further, drawing upon the experience and developments of the last twenty or so years.</p>

<p>The origins of <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> History in Australia</p>
<p>At the same time that Robert French was publishing his work, others were also moving into the field. In <date value="1987">1987</date> Margaret Bradstock and Louise Wakeling edited a collection of lesbian autobiographical essays in which eighteen women discussed their lives. It was a book that uncovered some of the richness of Australian lesbian history stretching over the entire twentieth century and celebrated optimism and courage that many might have found surprising in the lives of an oppressed group.<note xml:id="fn4-87" n="4"><p><hi rend="sup">4</hi>Margaret Bradstock and Louise Wakeling, eds, <hi rend="i">Words From the Same Heart</hi>, Sydney: Hale and Iremonger, <date value="1987">1987</date>.</p></note> Garry Wotherspoon edited a comparable collection of male life-stories in <date value="1986">1986</date> titled <hi rend="i">Being Different</hi> and then, in <date value="1991">1991</date>, he produced <hi rend="i">City of the Plain</hi>, his history of camp and gay Sydney since the <date value="1920">1920s</date>.<note xml:id="fn5-87" n="5"><p><hi rend="sup">5</hi>Garry Wotherspoon, <hi rend="i">Being Different: nine gay men remember</hi>, Sydney: Hale &amp; Iremonger, <date value="1986">1986</date>; and his <hi rend="i">City of the Plain: history of a gay sub-culture</hi>, Sydney: Hale and Iremonger, <date value="1991">1991</date>.</p></note> Building upon the work of the Sydney Gay History Group, an informal gathering of those interested in pursuing research in the infant discipline, he went on to edit and co-edit several volumes of Gay (later Lesbian and Gay) Perspectives, which brought together the work of many historians of gay Australia. Wotherspoon was an academic, a lecturer in economic history at the University of Sydney, and he brought to all this work a rigour that demonstrated beyond doubt that gay and lesbian history was a field that could grow in scope and credibility. But he brought, too, the sensibility and the insider-knowledge that his active participation in the emerging Sydney gay and lesbian community gave him.</p>
<p>This combination of academic skill and community connections marked Australian <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history from its birth, and remains an important element in its ongoing development. Denise Thompson, inspired by research she conducted as part of her employment by the <hi rend="c">Nsw</hi> Anti-Discrimination Board, published in <date value="1985">1985</date> a detailed examination of the early years of gay and lesbian politics in Sydney, providing a lively and challenging account strongly inflected by her lesbian feminist perspective, giving many readers, for the first time, an insight into the political divisions of the movement and its historians.<note xml:id="fn6-87" n="6"><p><hi rend="sup">6</hi>Denise Thompson, <hi rend="i">Flaws in the Social Fabric: Homosexuals and society in Sydney</hi>, Sydney: George Allen and Unwin, <date value="1985">1985</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>All of these works were scholarly in the best sense, drawing upon careful attention to their sources, respect for participants and a desire to communicate with wide audiences. For the most part, too, their work was published by reputable, mainstream publishers. It is not surprising that many expected a breakthrough into the universities &#x2013; bringing gay and lesbian studies to fruition as an academic discipline, with the same kind of research, teaching and publishing structures that women's studies had achieved in the <date value="1970">1970s</date> and eighties.</p>

<p>A community-based history</p>
<p>These expectations, however, were not met. In general, the universities have played a minor role in <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history. This is not based on any hostility to homosexuality &#x2013; many scholars have built successful academic careers in this and cognate fields. The universities have facilitated research and publication in these fields, especially during the heyday of 'queer studies', which reflected the rise of postmodernism, textualism, the 'linguistic turn' and discourse theory in the <date value="1990">1990s</date> &#x2013; a field in which Australian scholarship achieved
<pb xml:id="n6" n="6"/>
an international standing. But there is very much less to report in relation to university <hi rend="i">teaching</hi>. In <date value="1999">1999</date>, Donovan and Chan conducted a survey of <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> studies as it was being taught in Australian universities.<note xml:id="fn7-87" n="7"><p><hi rend="sup">7</hi>Raymond Donovan and Leong K. Chan, eds, <hi rend="i">Gay Lesbian and Queer Studies in Australia</hi>, Sydney: Australian Centre for Lesbian and Gay Research, University of Sydney, <date value="1999">1999</date>.</p></note> They found very few subjects devoted exclusively to <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> issues and only 32 which had significant <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> content. While there was certainly some under-reporting in the figures, the fact remains that this was a surprisingly small number of subjects for what was emerging as a major national research field.</p>
<p>It is doubtful that a similar survey conducted today would reveal any increase in the offerings available, and in the meantime, the only subject devoted exclusively to Australian gay and lesbian history has come and gone. 'From Mateship to Mardi Gras' (<hi rend="c">Fmtmg</hi>) was taught at the Australian Centre at the University of Melbourne and brought an interdisciplinary approach to two centuries of Australian queer history. Offered at various times as a summer intensive incorporating a field trip to Mardi Gras and as a standard semester subject, <hi rend="c">Fmtmg</hi> inspired some community-based scholarship (such as Rachel Cook's <hi rend="i">Closets Are For Clothes</hi>, a history of queer Australia for young adult readers) and occasional honours theses. In the end, the subject fell victim to structural issues rather than homophobia. As universities have become increasingly business-like, managerialist assumptions about profitability and economies of scale have started to squeeze out small subjects. Why pay someone to teach 20 or 30 students in seminar-sized classes when you can pay them to teach 200 or 300 or more in a lecture theatre? There was, simply, not enough consumer demand for <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> studies, not enough of a market, to justify offering such subjects.</p>
<p>Equally important, though, is the place occupied by sexuality studies generally, and queer studies in particular, within the broader world of the university. It was striking to observe that, of those students who did <hi rend="c">Fmtmg</hi>, about two-thirds to three-quarters were women, divided pretty equally into gay and straight; about a third or less were men, and they were mostly gay. It is a fact &#x2013; surprising to some of us &#x2013; that gay and lesbian studies has remained very much within the minority-studies paradigm. Unlike gender and race, which are widely seen as structures and practices which have contributed fundamentally and foundationally to the nature of the national community, sexuality is seen as entirely marginal; and homosexuality, especially, is seen as being not much more than the state of being of a small group of people; at most, as a community whose history may well be worth unearthing and celebrating, but not one that is in any way important. Indeed, so little is it seen as a central part of the national story that very few scholars &#x2013; and very, very few straight scholars &#x2013; include it in their teaching at all.</p>
<p>But actually, this matters less than might be expected. (Which is just as well, as there are few signs that it is likely to change any time soon.) Universities often see themselves as a society's primary generator and repository of knowledge. This is not true. Most knowledge that most people have about anything has only the most peripheral connection to the world of scholarship, and much that is new and interesting in the universities has its origins outside in the wider community. Queer history is a case in point. Queer history comes into the universities through people embedded in the
<pb xml:id="n7" n="7"/>
movements and community and it survives and thrives chiefly as a form of public rather than academic history. It does this not only because it <hi rend="i">has</hi> to, because the universities are doing so little of it. It survives and thrives also because it is <hi rend="i">able</hi> to; the necessary resources exist outside the universities and are nurtured and developed there. An infrastructure exists to sustain the work associated with the construction of the field of gay and lesbian and queer history. It is an infrastructure with many elements which, between them, add up to a solidly-grounded community-based and community-oriented research and dissemination structure. I would like to review some of these.</p>
<p>The existence of the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives is a case in point. Established in <date value="1978">1978</date> by a vote of the Fourth National Homosexual Conference, which was held that year in Sydney, the collection has been housed in Melbourne because this is where those who wished to set it up, and were prepared to do the work to build it, happened to live. In the 30-plus years since its establishment, the Archives has built a collection that is indispensable for the doing of Australian <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history. (At some point a decision was taken to restrict collecting activities to Australian materials). The Archives includes newspapers and magazines produced by the movement and community dating back to <date value="1969">1969</date>-<date value="1970">1970</date>, as well as newsletters, books, t-shirts, badges, posters, ephemera, newspaper clippings, scrap books, oral history interviews, off-air recordings, and papers of organisations and individuals. The range is impressive enough; the comprehensiveness even more so. Virtually every issue of every newspaper and magazine published since <date value="1970">1970</date> is held &#x2013; over <date review="1000">1000</date> titles (over 40 000 items). There are scores of recorded interviews; posters and badges in their hundreds. The ephemera files (containing flyers, tickets, topical sets of clippings) &#x2013; from 10/40 Conference to Zipper Club &#x2013; number <date review="1700">1700</date>. The Archives has been, from its foundation, a community-based, volunteer-run, notfor-profit organisation. Financially, it is sustained by membership fees and donations, occasional small community-based and, more recently, government-sponsored heritage grants, and the generous provision of space (the collection's single biggest need) by the Victorian <hi rend="c">Aids</hi> Council. The spare-time efforts of dozens of individuals over the decades have collected, preserved, listed, indexed, publicised and celebrated the holdings, and the history that they embody. <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> is not the only such collection in Australia. The Women's Liberation and Lesbian Feminist Archive, now housed in the University of Melbourne Archives, and the Gay and Lesbian Archives of Western Australia have more tightly defined collecting interests. State libraries have, in recent years, been more actively collecting in the field as well.</p>
<p>As this emphasis on the volunteer and community-based nature of the collections suggests, one of the great resources of the <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history world is the time and energy, or the passion (to use a somewhat debased term), of large numbers of individuals. (The <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history community, at least, has reason to be very excited by the aging of the population, with all that that means in terms of new swathes of free time waiting to be utilised.) Much of this work goes on unseen by the wider world. The people who list and index the collections, negotiate with donors, answer inquiries, develop policy, hold open
<pb xml:id="n8" n="8"/>
days and working bees and design and maintain website, almost without exception, do so without payment and in their own time.</p>
<p>Beyond collecting, such dedication finds expression in individual projects. Jean Taylor has produced a monumental herstory of the women's liberation movement in Victoria covering the decade of the <date value="1970">1970s</date>. In 770 pages she details the lives and struggles of womyn<note xml:id="fn8-87" n="8"><p><hi rend="sup">8</hi>See the following note for an explanation for the use of the spelling.</p></note> activists with particular attention to Indigenous and lesbian activists, whose work has been so often overlooked in mainstream histories.<note xml:id="fn9-87" n="9"><p><hi rend="sup">9</hi>Jean Taylor, <hi rend="i">Brazen Hussies: a herstory of radical activism in the Women's Liberation Movement in Victoria, <date value="1970">1970</date>-<date value="1979">1979</date></hi>, Brunswick East, Vic.: Dyke Books, <date value="2009">2009</date>. The use of 'herstory' and 'womyn' reflects a radical feminist respelling to extricate the category 'women' from its linguistic (and therefore social and political) dependence upon the category 'man'.</p></note> On a smaller but no less valuable scale, we have Wayne Murdoch's listings of camp and queer references from Melbourne's Truth newspaper. Adam Carr began an index to the community paper <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi> and <hi rend="i">Outrage</hi>; this was later expanded and completed by <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> volunteers, who have since continued their work on other publications. Graham Carbery has researched and published a history of Mardi Gras, a listing of newspaper editorials, and a national state-by-state history of homosexual law reform. Even less visible, perhaps, is the work of Gary Jaynes who has relentlessly tracked the lives of Cyril Howe, Max Du Barry, Val Eastwood and a small host of other characters who now enliven our histories of pre- and post-War Melbourne.<note xml:id="fn10-87" n="10"><p><hi rend="sup">10</hi>For an overview of the Archives and its collections, see the <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> website <ptr target="http://www.alga.org.au"/>.</p></note></p>
<p>Of course, all this work would be of little value if it were not made public. And again the <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> communities have the resources to bring this material to the world's attention. The gay and lesbian press has been very keen, at various times, to publish regular history columns. Usually between 100 to 250 words in length, and appearing weekly or fortnightly, these columns present snapshots of events, people and places that have shaped the camp/gay/queer world. Topics ranged from beats to <hi rend="c">Aids</hi> to Radicalesbianism, from Dennis Altman to Fred Nile, from the Tasty nightclub raid to Pride March. The press has also been a vehicle for publicising the books and other products of the history-writers. Beyond the press, the community has supported other initiatives which facilitate the collection and dissemination of queer history. The annual Australian Homosexual Histories Conference brings together established and junior academics, independent scholars and the just plain interested, and provides them with opportunities to present and discuss the work they have in progress. On two occasions, some of the papers of these conferences have been collected and published.<note xml:id="fn11-87" n="11"><p><hi rend="sup">11</hi>David L. Phillips and Graham Willett, eds, <hi rend="i">Australia's Homosexual Histories: gay and lesbian perspectives V</hi>, Sydney and Melbourne: Australian Centre for Lesbian and Gay Research and the Australian Lesbian Gay Archives, <date value="2001">2001</date>; Yorick Smaal and Graham Willett, eds, <hi rend="i">Out Here: gay and lesbian perspectives VI</hi>, Clayton, Vic.: Monash University Publishing, <date value="2011">2011</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>The skills required to edit and publish are widespread within the community and many of the publications that exist are the product of community-based work rather than of commercial publication. In very recent times we have seen the emergence of a business model that will allow for the publication of hard copy, and electronic and print-on-demand versions of the same book in what looks to be commercially viable ways, exemplified, for example, by Monash University Publishing. This has broken down the barriers between commercial and community publishing to the benefit of the field of <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history, amongst others.<note xml:id="fn12-87" n="12"><p><hi rend="sup">12</hi>For example, Smaal and Willett, eds, <hi rend="i">Out Here</hi>.</p></note></p>
<p>The existence of such outlets for the dissemination of <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history is important. Knowing that one's work does not need to sit rotting in the bottom drawer; knowing that there are ways of sharing it; knowing that there are others doing it too &#x2013; all of these
<pb xml:id="n9" n="9"/>
are powerful motivators for what can often be lonely work. There is no point trying to evade the emotional and psychological aspects of what is going on here. The desire to collect, to share, to celebrate our lives, which drives most <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> activism, is done by many of us as a way of sharing, celebrating and validating our history. There are many ways in which this might produce less than rigorous work, and be based on reluctance to problematise some of the underlying assumptions discussed below. The work does what it does and the way that it does it for a particular set of reasons and those who seek to do it differently (unambiguously academically, for example, or via methods of critique and problematisation) have plenty of scope for doing so within purely academic contexts.</p>

<p>Perhaps more than anything, for the community-oriented historians there is the solace of knowing that there are people wanting to enjoy one's work. The audience that clearly exists is also a resource of its own kind. Audiences consume the histories of <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> Australia that are produced but they also often provide the material that historians and collecting institutions have to work with; and they shape the forms in which it, the histories, are presented.</p>
<pb xml:id="n10" n="10"/>
<p>Exhibitions are important and there have been more of them than the casual observer might expect. By one count (which actually underestimates the number of exhibitions and gets some of the details wrong), between <date value="1982">1982</date> and <date value="2005">2005</date>, there were 27 exhibitions focusing on <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history staged in Australia.<note xml:id="fn13-87" n="13"><p><hi rend="sup">13</hi>Andrew Murray-Gorman, 'So, Where is Queer? A critical geography of Queer exhibitions in Australia', <hi rend="i">Museums and Social Issues</hi>, vol. 3, no. 1, Spring <date value="2008">2008</date>, pp. 67-80.</p></note> For the most part, these were small-scale, community-based efforts supported by small institutions. The Liverpool Regional Museum, for example, has hosted two such exhibitions &#x2013; 'Just Sensational!' (<date value="2000">2000</date>) and 'Edges' (<date value="2001">2001</date>) &#x2013; and in <date value="2005">2005</date> the City Gallery, operated by the City of Melbourne's Art and Heritage Unit, staged 'Camp As . . . Melbourne in the <date value="1950">1950s</date>'. But when major state institutions throw their weight behind such efforts and draw on community-based expertise, these exhibitions can be impressive affairs. 'The Gay Museum' at the Western Australian Museum (<date value="2003">2003</date>) and 'Prejudice and Pride', at the Museum of Brisbane over several months in <date value="2010">2010</date> are perhaps the finest such exhibitions staged in Australia to date. Such exhibitions have the benefit of funding and curatorial skill that no community group could ever afford &#x2013; which is reflected in the very high production values of the displays and catalogues. But they benefit, too, from the expertise of community-based historians who know the stories and can access artefacts and memorabilia.</p>
<p>State support can come in other, less obvious, forms. The 'Forbidden Love, Bold Passion' exhibition was based on interviews conducted by members of History Inverted, a lesbian history collective, in which Melbourne lesbians were invited to share their stories. Fragments of some of these were turned into a display which opened in the foyer of the State Library of Victoria in <date value="1997">1997</date>. Stylishly designed, with closet doors to hold the placards and display items, the exhibition attracted good crowds. But the funding was not just for the Melbourne exhibition. The display toured Australia with the financial support of Visions of Australia (the federal government's touring exhibitions grants scheme) and appeared in a number of localities including Hobart and Newcastle. The organising collective's decision to encourage those regions which took the exhibition to prepare and include panels focusing on their own pasts, encouraged local lesbian histories to be unearthed and incorporated into the national story.</p>
<p>Gay and lesbian audiences embrace these histories enthusiastically. The newspaper columns have been, by all accounts, among the most popular items in the papers in which they appear. History walks &#x2013; offered on a regular basis in Melbourne and Adelaide and occasionally in Sydney &#x2013; usually garner paying crowds in their scores (hundreds if we are not careful). The income generated matters to the small organisations that offer the walks, but so too do the stories that members of the crowd bring along with them, or suddenly remember: places we had not known about; or stories of attending a certain venue and of something interesting or poignant that happened there; or even just a description of what the places looked like inside. Then there are the rumours, remembrance of old gossip, never written down, of course: a certain local councillor, perhaps even the mayor of Fitzroy having been 'that way'. These stories are an invaluable source of clues for further research. One of <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>'s great treasures is its set of Tommy McDermott's photo albums. They show in a few dozen photos the social life of Tommy
<pb xml:id="n11" n="11"/>
and his friends &#x2013; drag parties, both domestic and public; a weekend away at Sorrento, couples embracing for the camera &#x2013; and it came to light as result of Russel Grant's visit to the <date value="2005">2005</date> 'Camp As . . .' exhibition, which set him wondering whether the Archives might be interested in the photos that he had inherited.</p>
<p>As this suggests, this work is directed at wide publics (both gay and straight), and it is produced in the vernacular &#x2013; in ways that appeal to, and make sense to, people without academic training. In newspaper columns and history walks and exhibitions, queer history has been presented as entertainment. So, too, in radio programs, such as 'Queen City of the South'. Produced by Barry McKay with the support of Joy Radio, Melbourne's <hi rend="c">Glbti</hi> radio station. 'Queen City' was broadcast in 23 episodes and then made available as a website.<note xml:id="fn14-87" n="14"><p><hi rend="sup">14</hi>'Queen City of the South: Melbourne Queer history radio series', http://melbqueerhistory.tripod. com/, accessed <date value="2010-07-30"><date review=" -01-30">30 July 2010</date></date>.</p></note> But other more ambitious projects have been undertaken, too. In Adelaide, two staged musicals have been presented drawing upon the rich oral history interviews of Adelaide camp men from the <date value="1930">1930s</date> and <date value="1940">1940s</date>, collected by John Lee. 'The Pink Files' (Music and Lyrics by Sean Peer, Book by Ian Purcell) tells the story of Bert Heinz and the Lampshade Shop scandal. 'The King of the West End' recounts the sexual adventures of Bert Edwards who was, at various times a publican and community leader, Labor member of the state parliament, prisoner in Yatala gaol, and city councillor for the West End of Adelaide. Set to music, these stories come to life in ways that mere words on pages rarely do. In Melbourne, prominent drag performer Kaye Sera has used published and unpublished sources, as well has her own interviews, to enliven her set of songs of the <date value="1960">1960s</date>. One of the most memorable examples of how to bring scholarship to the people was offered by Susan Aykut, then of Monash University's public history program. During Midsumma <date value="2004">2004</date>, she offered a paper on the history of the bathhouse, from ancient times to their contemporary incarnation as sex-venues for gay men (and, occasionally, lesbians). Strikingly, it was presented in Wet on Wellington, one of Melbourne's premier gay saunas, during non-business hours. To the delight of a capacity crowd of 100, Aykut was ushered to the lectern by men dressed only in towels (the usual attire at saunas), from whence she proceeded to present the results of her research. From time to time, as she was about to quote from her sources, one of her assistants would pop up from the audience, and recite it for her. Lavishly illustrated, she presented what was a perfectly respectable scholarly paper, in a less-than-respectable environment, to an audience who positively lapped it up . . . and no doubt learned much in the process.</p>
<p>But the audiences were not only queer. The political motives of most of those who were celebrating <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history brought them to seek ever-wider audiences in the broader community. In celebrating our lives and history we were hoping, among other things, to transform public opinion as well.</p>
<p>In <date value="2001">2001</date>, for example, the gay and lesbian communities were keen to participate in the national Centenary of Federation celebrations. And the various state Centenary of Federation funding agencies were happy to assist with grants for the production of events. It was for the Centenary that Adelaide staged 'The Pink Files'. In Sydney, an exhibition entitled 'Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know', celebrated the 'Oscar Wildes of Sydney',
<pb xml:id="n12" n="12"/>
Lord Beauchamp, the gay governor, and Iris Webber among a host of other camp/gay/ queer figures from Sydney history. Initiated by the Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, it was presented in the foyer of the state parliament, and formally opened by the President of the Legislative Council. In Melbourne, Pride March and the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives were funded to organise a contingent in the <date value="2001-05">May 2001</date> parade commemorating the opening of the first federal parliament. A crowd of a couple of dozen lesbians and gay men, transgender and bisexual folk, wearing pink, black and white uniforms marched with cube-shaped display boxes bearing the images of <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> historical people, places and events. The watching crowd was receptive enough, although it was said at the time that, as the contingent approached the cameras that were beaming the show into the nation's loungerooms, the directors chose to cut to an ad break.</p>

<p>In its reliance upon, and orientation towards, these community audiences, <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history is doing what a lot of academic history aspires to do &#x2013; it is making its stories relevant to the wider world. But this history-making is worth the attention of scholars in other ways too. In struggling to make sense of a past that has been largely concealed, <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> researchers and writers have had to find ways to access, and to understand, lives that were vilified, marginalised and (in the case of gay men) criminalised, and subcultures that, when they existed at all, carefully concealed themselves. Evidence of homosexual lives and practices was often not produced at all; or it was destroyed by family, friends and colleagues keen to protect the reputations of their loved ones. Unearthing such histories calls for techniques and approaches and ways of seeing that are not necessarily those practiced or valued in the more formally constituted institutions. It calls for what classical historian Mary Beard refers to, in a rather different context, as 'those tantalising processes of investigation, deduction, empathy, reconstruction and sheer guesswork'.<note xml:id="fn15-87" n="15"><p><hi rend="sup">15</hi>Mary Beard, <hi rend="i">The Parthenon</hi>, Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, <date value="2010">2010</date>, p. 43.</p></note></p>
<p>What we might call a queer eye, a camp sensibility, or a 'little bit of intuition' is of value here. Looking at the forecourt of the State Library of Victoria, for example, queer folk may see a space rather at odds with the civic intentions of the designers. On the left, St George,<note xml:id="fn16-87" n="16"><p><hi rend="sup">16</hi>The statue is discussed in Shane Carmody's article in this issue.</p></note> a finely-muscled, stark naked man upon a rearing stallion, enormous lance in hand, a writhing serpent impaled under him. On the right, St Joan of Arc, a notorious cross-dresser. It is no surprise that many of the Lesbian and Gay Archives history walks begin here, at what is arguably ground zero for Queer Melbourne.</p>
<p>Less frivolously, perhaps, there is the expertise that someone trained in, and committed to, queer history can bring to the task of unearthing the <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> past. In her article in this volume, Kate Davison discusses the survey which she conducted for the Museum of Victoria and the State Library to locate public holdings of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> records and artefacts in Victoria.<note xml:id="fn17-87" n="17"><p><hi rend="sup">17</hi>Kate Davison, <hi rend="i">Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay and Transgender Material Survey, Project Report</hi>, Melbourne: Museum Victoria, <date value="2006">2006</date>.</p></note> In the space of a year or two her efforts took the Museum's catalogue listings of items relevant to queer history from nine objects to 97 &#x2013; with another 80 which were relevant to sexuality more generally and to feminist history. This remarkable increase refers not to the new collections and items that she unearthed (they are recorded separately), but to material that was held already but had not been understood in a <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> context. This is not to suggest that &#x2013; as might have been true in the past &#x2013; that curators had deliberately concealed such associations; rather it is to argue that it requires a willingness to see, and an ability to do so, that the discipline of queer history has cultivated in its practitioners.</p>
<p>The willingness to see is important. Many of those who do <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history talk of giving the past 'the benefit of the doubt', reversing the heterosexual assumption that we must have incontrovertible evidence of homosexuality before we can name it as such. Arguing that this creates a burden of proof that does not apply to the identification of heterosexuality in past lives, the suggestion is that we might want to remain open to the possibility of reversing the onus of proof, or at least keeping our options open.

But Flinders' ardour was not always reciprocated: 'your apparent coolness towards me [he writes], and the unpleasant manner you took to point out my failings, roused my pride and cooled my ardour'.

And yet, if we allow ourselves to think beyond the text for a moment, what do we see? What behaviour is described? What feelings? Bass's presence upon the deck breaks Flinders' concentration and the younger man rushes up on deck to be with him. Bass's coldness produces a state of acute anxiety. These behaviours and emotions surely tell us about something other than epistle-forms: if this was a Miss Bennett writing to a Mr Darcy, we would be in no doubt at all as to what it meant. None of this is to suggest that Bass and Flinders engaged in the kind of genital intermingling that might let us claim them as homosexual in any modern sense &#x2013; the fact is, we cannot know at all whether such acts ever took place. But in trying to think about what these words reflect, it is not so much that we are overplaying the queer eye here; rather, it requires a certain doggedness not to see Flinders' emotional turmoil as anything other than the outpourings of a man in (unrequited, and perhaps unconscious) love.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to suggest that these processes of seeing, of locating queerness in the past, are unproblematic. To take one example: in her survey for the State Library and the Museum, Kate Davison identifies a silver teapot held by the Museum and locates it within the story of Anne Drysdale and Caroline Newcomb, 'the lady squatters', whose life together on their property on Victoria's Bellarine Peninsula between <date value="1840">1840</date> and <date value="1853">1853</date> has long been claimed for lesbian history. Bev Roberts, who has edited an edition of Drysdale's diary and began researching their lives in the hope of claiming them for the lesbian pantheon, has concluded that it makes very little sense to think of these women as lesbians at all.<note xml:id="fn20-87" n="20"><p><hi rend="sup">20</hi>Bev Roberts, 'Miss Newcomb's Teapot', in this volume.</p></note> The Davison-Roberts debate alerts us to the ways in which our assumptions, and the ways in which we weigh evidence &#x2013; and how we weigh the absence of evidence &#x2013; will shape our conclusions. Despite their similar backgrounds as feminists with an interest in lesbian histories, these women have come nonetheless to very different conclusions about the nature of the past that they are seeing &#x2013; a reminder of the inherently complex and ambiguous nature of the queer past.</p>
<p>The fact is that we often cannot know for sure what it is we are seeing, but this can elicit efforts beyond those usually required of historians, and can provide models for doing our history with less complacency. Take, for example, the Arthur R. Groves'
<pb xml:id="n15" n="15"/>
manuscript book of verse, held in the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives. This handwritten volume contains about two dozen poems organised around several themes: love poems, war poems, poems in a lighter vein and post-war verses. Each poem is noted with place and date ranging from 'At sea <date value="1906">1906</date>', via 'Entre Rios' (Argentina) <date value="1909">1909</date> and <date value="1910">1910</date> and Paraguay <date value="1913">1913</date>, to the war poems from France <date value="1915">1915</date>-<date value="1917">1917</date> and Italy <date value="1918">1918</date>, to London and England <date value="1919">1919</date>. The cover has stuck to it an Australian-stamped envelope addressed to Mr Stuart Hunter of Lakes Entrance.<note xml:id="fn21-87" n="21"><p><hi rend="sup">21</hi>Arthur Groves, unpublished book of verse, Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives.</p></note></p>
<p>Beyond that there is precious little that we know for sure. (It didn't help that for some time we had assumed that the author was Greys, rather than Groves, having misread the handwriting.)<note xml:id="fn22-87" n="22"><p><hi rend="sup">22</hi>A newspaper search has revealed an article from Paraguay written by Arthur Groves in <date value="1912">1912</date> which fits the dating of the poems, 'Where Revolutions Rage: Sydney Man in Paraguay', <hi rend="i">Hobart Mercury</hi>, <date value="1912-10-09">9 October 1912</date>, p. 3.</p></note> But the person who found the volume in a second hand shop and donated it to the Archives had little doubt about what he was looking at, though the volume does not reveal itself explicitly, unambiguously or definitively. We need to bring to it some of the skills we have been discussing here, which may be summed up in the word 'speculation'. The book contains a photograph of 'the author of these verses', Arthur R. Groves. He is wearing something that looks to the modern eye strikingly like a feather boa; it is more likely the collar of a pilot's flying jacket. But questions arise: are his eyebrows artfully shaped? Are his lips rouged? Is that pose, with the demurely downcast eyes, just a little too <hi rend="i">wistful</hi>? And what of the dedication &#x2013; ' To my friend/from his friend/ the author of these verses/London <date value="1920-07">July 1920</date>'?</p>
<p>And then there are the poems themselves. Love appears frequently. Nothing unusual there. But always as 'he': O cover me with lilies! In the day/Love came to me with splendour and a sweet surprise,/And took my hand in his, and stole away/My heart with his unfathomable eyes'. Again not unprecedented. But in a collection of poetry, written by a man, dedicated and sent to a man &#x2013; surely we are entitled to consider the possibility that there is a bond here that goes beyond mere mateship. To consider, but not to conclude. But sometimes that is all we have to go on, and as far as we can go.</p>
<p>Or consider the case of Ethel May Punshon &#x2013; Monte to her friends. Monte's scrapbooks came to the Archives shortly after her death in <date value="1989">1989</date> at the age of 106. As far as we can tell, she had been clipping newspapers and magazines over many years, and at some point she sat down and pasted them all into two large scrapbooks. No sources, no dates, although they seem to be <date value="1930">1930s</date> and forties and after. But it is the subject matter that is most interesting. Apart from a number that were clipped from Japanese press (Monte fell in love with Japan after a visit there in the <date value="1920">1920s</date> and went so far as to learn the language), the content is entirely composed of stories and photos of nonconforming women. There were 'aviators, motor-boat racers, racing motorists, jockeys and sailors, and women adventurers and sportswomen'.<note xml:id="fn23-87" n="23"><p><hi rend="sup">23</hi>Ruth Ford, 'Speculating on Scrapbooks, Sex and Desire', <hi rend="i">Australian Historical Studies</hi>, no. 106, <date value="1996">1996</date>, p. 113.</p></note> There were passing women &#x2013; women who lived 'disguised' as, or 'personating', men &#x2013; and even naked women, artfully but revealingly posed for the camera. Many of the photos were of attractive and stylish women but with a particular emphasis on the style of the modern, rather boyish, look of the <date value="1920">1920s</date> and 30s: short hair, slim lines and flattened breast lines, occasionally rather mannish clothes such as jackets and ties.</p>

<p>If all we had were the scrapbooks we would be required (as with Arthur Groves) to engage in what Ruth Ford has referred to as 'speculating'.<note xml:id="fn24-87" n="24"><p><hi rend="sup">24</hi>Ibid.</p></note> This is not about wishful thinking, or imposing our values on the past, or reading too much into the evidence. Speculating is a technique employed by historians for particular purposes &#x2013; to make sense of events, episodes, people about whom we do not have clear, unambiguous knowledge. It starts with intuition or a queer eye, but goes beyond these. It is best thought of, I would suggest, as a kind of archaeology. Not in the Foucauldian sense of seeking origins, but in the more literal sense &#x2013; modeled on the way that archaeologists themselves use their craft to know the past from very partial evidence. An archaeologist presented with a shard, or a figurine, or the remains of a building, will know very much more about it than the object itself reveals &#x2013; he/she will draw upon the accumulated knowledge of many people over many years to locate and understand the piece, usually with a high degree of confidence and accuracy.</p>
<p>So too for those of us who practice the art of queer history. Presented with a poem or a letter or a photo, we often know more than is obvious; we are often able to divine &#x2013; from our knowledge of the historical period in which it was produced, and of the ways in which people expressed themselves, and from our work with the history of
<pb xml:id="n17" n="17"/>
mainstream and marginalised cultures &#x2013; what this object might <hi rend="i">mean</hi>. It is always, of course, somewhat provisional, and is subject (as all historical knowledge is) to debate and correction or later reinterpretation. But things taken in context (a knowledge that is the outcome of years of work by many people), speak very differently to things taken in isolation. For example, Monte's scrapbooks cannot be definitive. They are, as Ruth Ford argued, a 'rich autobiographical source'<note xml:id="fn25-87" n="25"><p><hi rend="sup">25</hi>Ibid, p. 113.</p></note> and when Ford places their contents side by side with other evidence that we have about Monte &#x2013; photos reproduced in her autobiography, <hi rend="i">Monte-San</hi>,<note xml:id="fn26-87" n="26"><p><hi rend="sup">26</hi>Ethel May Punshon, <hi rend="i">Monte-San: The Times Between: life lies hidden</hi>, Kobe: Kobe Japan-Australia Society, <date value="1987">1987</date>.</p></note> a wider knowledge of the styles of the <date value="1920">1920s</date> and thirties and so on &#x2013; it would not be hard, or unreasonable, to draw the conclusion that Monte was, in our terms, a lesbian.</p>
<p>What <hi rend="i">is</hi> definitive, however, is Monte's own account of her life. Monte lived long enough to give an account of herself and her life. In an interview with <hi rend="i">City Rhythm</hi>, a Melbourne-based gay scene magazine in <date value="1985">1985</date> (when she was 102) she discussed her 'first love, and the greatest experience of my life . . . the love of my life', a woman called Debbie. She discussed their relationship including the great mental and physical attraction between them, and the pain that she experienced when, after 12 years, Debbie left her for another woman.<note xml:id="fn27-87" n="27"><p><hi rend="sup">27</hi>'Monte: In Love With a Memory', <hi rend="i">City Rhythm</hi>, no. 30, <date value="1985-04">April</date>/<date value="1985-05">May 1985</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>Monte never, so far as we know, referred to herself as a lesbian; but there is no doubt at all that her primary emotional and physical attraction was to women, and that the one great romantic relationship of her life was with Debbie, whose loss she mourned for many decades. Her friends included a group of camp men (her 'homosexual boyfriends' she called them in her <hi rend="i">City Rhythm</hi> interview) and she moved in camp circles all through her life, and, in the very last years, was reasonably at home in the gay and lesbian scene. Our speculation as to Monte's sexuality, had we needed to engage in it, would, we know, have been right in this case. We cannot always have such certainty, but this case gives us reason for a certain modest confidence in the methodology.</p>

<head>Conclusion</head>
<p>Universities have a very high opinion of themselves and often assume that they are the prime source of society's knowledge and ideas. But in the case of gay, lesbian and queer history, this is much less true than in other realms of inquiry. By necessity and by choice, <hi rend="c">Glq</hi> history has largely been the work of community-based scholarship, as much celebratory as academic, emerging from, and oriented towards, a very different set of peers. This is strength as much as a deficit. And it has led the discipline to develop innovative approaches that academic work might well want to consider more closely. In the absence of such engagement, it is not the community-based history that is the loser.</p>

<p><hi rend="c">This is One</hi> of a number of remarkable letters written by Harry Bruin, a carpenter of Harcourt Street, Auburn, to Ben Morris, a 21 year old office clerk, over a six month period in <date value="1919">1919</date>.<note xml:id="fn28-87" n="1"><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi>Trial of Harry Bruin and Ben Morris, Public Record Office of Victoria, <hi rend="c">Vprs</hi> 30 Criminal Trial Briefs <date value="1920">1920</date>/100.</p></note> Harry and Ben's relationship took place at a time when sexual contact between men was a crime punishable with prison and hard labour, and social attitudes forced them to hide their feelings for each other.</p>
<p>Homosexual history is hidden in archives and libraries and often only hinted at in the histories of the wider community. Most of the sources that historians take for granted simply don't exist for homosexual lives in the years before gay lib and decriminalisation. Letters and diaries detailing homosexual lives were either not produced in the first place, or were later destroyed by those who sought to avoid prosecution or social disgrace. Often the only substantial evidence of the homosexual subculture are the records of the persecutors; trial records, prison registers, outraged newspaper articles, medical and legal discussions of the 'problem' of homosexuality.</p>
<p>Harry and Ben's letters to each other survive only because they were used as evidence in court when they were accused of 'gross indecency' with each other following

a blackmail attempt in <date value="1920">1920</date>. For the past 90 years, two bundles of letters; Ben's original letters to Harry, and Harry's carefully kept carbon copies to Ben, have been kept in the collection of Criminal Trial Briefs held at the Public Record Office of Victoria, testament to two men's love for each other and evidence of a hidden subculture which existed in Melbourne between the two world wars.</p>
<p>Melbourne in <date value="1919">1919</date> was Australia's capital city, albeit temporarily whilst the future capital of Canberra was taking shape. A city of three-quarters of a million people,<note xml:id="fn29-87" n="2"><p><hi rend="sup">2</hi>Geoffrey Blainey, <hi rend="i">A History of Camberwell</hi>, Brisbane: Jacaranda Press, <date value="1964">1964</date>, p. 84.</p></note> half the Victorian population,<note xml:id="fn30-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi>Susan Priestley, <hi rend="i">Making Their Mark</hi>, Sydney: Fairfax, Syme &amp; Weldon, <date value="1984">1984</date>, p. 126.</p></note> its heart was surrounded by suburbs which spread in a ten mile arc from Sunshine in the west, to Preston in the north and out to Box Hill in the east and down the eastern bayside to Sandringham. The centre of the city was the business, commercial, shopping and entertainment heart of the city; by far the greatest proportion of Melbourne's population lived in the far flung suburbs, but they came into the city to work, shop, or be entertained.</p>
<p>During the <date value="1920">1920s</date> and '<date value="1930">30s</date> the pace of life grew faster; more cars were on the roads, large new buildings were built in the centre of the city and the suburbs sprawled out well beyond the ten-mile arc. Melbourne's population growth was steady; it reached the one million mark in <date value="1931">1931</date> and then held steady to <date value="1939">1939</date>,<note xml:id="fn31-87" n="4"><p><hi rend="sup">4</hi>1,076,500 in <date value="1940">1940</date> &#x2013; Don Garden, <hi rend="i">Victoria: a history</hi>, Melbourne, Thomas Nelson, <date value="1984">1984</date>, p. 365.</p></note> and the pace of modern life was clear to see all around. Wireless stations started broadcasting in <date value="1924">1924</date>, telephones became a more common part of everyday life (65 531 private phones in Melbourne in <date value="1931">1931</date>, with <date review="2946">2946</date> public phones).<note xml:id="fn32-87" n="5"><p><hi rend="sup">5</hi>Ibid, p. 335.</p></note> From about <date value="1910">1910</date> onwards some of the live theatres and music halls of Bourke Street were converted to cinemas, giving Melburnians another reason to come into the city. The weekly trip to the cinema became part of many people's lives, photographic tabloid newspapers were introduced with the <hi rend="i">Sun News-Pictorial</hi> in <date value="1922">1922</date>, and a wider range of consumer goods appeared in the shops to tempt the public.</p>
<p>The interwar years can be said to be the first period of mass consumer culture; films, wireless, gramophone records of overseas dance music, pictorial newspapers, all brought the world and its fashions closer than ever. Melbourne absorbed styles from overseas quicker than ever before, in clothes, architecture, music, literature and ideas. Suburban Melburnians eagerly awaited international news and thrilled to feats of aviation daring, air and land speed records being broken and new scientific discoveries being made.</p>
<p>For all the fast pace of modern life, for most Victorians life in the <date value="1920">1920s</date> and '<date value="1930">30s</date> was characterised by 'moral rectitude and social conservatism ... which gave Melbourne the reputation of being stultifyingly boring'.<note xml:id="fn33-87" n="6"><p><hi rend="sup">6</hi>Ibid, p. 292.</p></note> The overall tone of Melbourne in the first half of the twentieth century was that of one of staid provincialism. Historically, Victoria had significant numbers of non-conformists and Protestants, particularly Scots Presbyterians. In addition, the financial depression of the <date value="1890">1890s</date> had influenced popular attitudes in Victoria. Janet McCalman has said that the financial depression of the <date value="1890">1890s</date> 'were terrible years in Victoria. The Protestant churches saw their congregations shrink, the middle class was stricken with a failure of nerve, and a new chastened Puritanism overtook the suburbs. People acknowledged the virtue of living carefully'.<note xml:id="fn34-87" n="7"><p><hi rend="sup">7</hi>Janet McCalman, <hi rend="i">Journeyings: the biography of a middle class generation</hi>, <date value="1920">1920</date>-<date value="1990">1990</date>, Carlton, Vic: Melbourne University Press, <date value="1993">1993</date>, p. 55.</p></note> The 'chastened
<pb xml:id="n21" n="21"/>
Puritanism' resulted in the introduction of six o'clock closing in <date value="1916">1916</date> and gave the city a 'reputation as a dull city.<note xml:id="fn35-87" n="8"><p><hi rend="sup">8</hi>Garden, p. 332.</p></note></p>
<p>Although the <date value="1920">1920s</date> are usually portrayed as a period of liberation and rebellion following the horrors of the Great War, and as homosexual reform movements and subcultures developed in large cities around the world, including London, Paris and Berlin, homosexual lives and acts in Melbourne between the Wars were played out against a more restrictive legal and social background. Acts of sodomy, attempted sodomy or 'indecent assault upon a male person' attracted penalties of up to ten years imprisonment with hard labour and, thanks to new legislation introduced in <date value="1919">1919</date>, any form of actual or attempted 'gross indecency' committed whether in public or in private was also potentially punishable with prison terms. Although first time offenders of minor acts and those involving consenting adults, would often be fined or held over on good behaviour bonds, being caught in a homosexual act had wider consequences than just court and punishment; names and addresses were published in the press (particularly the tabloid press), and social ostracism and disgrace would follow.</p>
<p>However, a survey of cases heard in the Melbourne Supreme Court and Court of General Sessions between <date value="1919">1919</date> and <date value="1934">1934</date> (the most recent date for which court records have been released) show that of 200 cases in that period, only 40 involved two (or more) consenting adults (over the age of 21) and of those only ten involved acts committed in private. By far the bulk of the 200 cases involved adult men having sex with underage boys (aged under 14) or youths (aged 14 to 21) or consenting adults found having sex in public.</p>
<p>The fact that only ten cases involving consenting adults having sex in private were prosecuted by the Supreme and General Sessions courts in a 15 year period seems to point to the fact that the police and the courts were not actively hunting homosexuals as was the case in the later <date value="1940">1940s</date> and <date value="1950">1950s</date>. There's no suggestion in the press or the Victorian Criminal Trial Briefs held at the Victorian Public Records Office that police were involved in entrapment of homosexuals or the use of 'pretty police' as <hi rend="i">agents provocateur</hi> to lure homosexual men to commit offences. The ten cases where men who committed homosexual acts in private did find themselves in front of the bench involved jealous ex-lovers, suspicious landladies and mothers and one case where an emotionally disturbed man turned himself in to the police!</p>
<p>It can be said then that although homosexual men in Melbourne lived their lives against a background of legal and social proscription, the interwar period did not seem to have been as bleak and forbidding as the period after the Second World War, when the Vice Squad deliberately entrapped men using beats and drilled holes in the walls of flats to gather evidence. The seeming lack of interest in homosexuals shown by the police, coupled with the fact that much of the public seemed unaware of homosexuals in their midst, allowed a greater degree of freedom for men who liked other men.</p>
<p>What then was life like for homosexual men in Melbourne between the Wars?
<pb xml:id="n22" n="22"/>
Of course, at any time in history, homosexual men have the same needs, concerns and activities as the wider population &#x2013; finding somewhere to live, some way of supporting themselves, feeding themselves, and holding together relationships, be they family, friends or lovers. Added to these usual concerns was the fact that they belonged to a secret subculture, potentially liable to prosecution and social exposure. Then as now, the subculture ranged from men who didn't identify as homosexual (a word first used in an Australian newspaper in <date value="1906">1906</date>)<note xml:id="fn36-87" n="9"><p><hi rend="sup">9</hi>'The Unsexed &#x2013; Men in Female Form &#x2013; Woman with Men's Bodies &#x2013; The Ellis-Weinenger Sex Theory &#x2013; The Effeminancy of Whitman &#x2013; Some Famous Homo-Sexuals', <hi rend="i">Truth</hi>, <date value="1906-10-03">3 October 1906</date>, p. 12.</p></note> and who might live 'normal' lives, married in the suburbs and occasionally indulge in a furtive encounter in a park or other quiet place; men who lived with other men quietly as committed couples, passing themselves off as brothers, cousins or best friends to the neighbours, recognisable 'queans' who, though dressed as men, used makeup and effeminate mannerisms and a few, very brave souls who ventured out in full drag, even during the day to 'pass' (ie, as a woman) in Collins Street or Bourke Street.</p>
<p>Some of the institutions and aspects of homosexual life in the interwar period were well established before the Great War; beats, friendship networks and public places which acted as clandestine meeting places, such as hotels and cafes; others developed during the interwar period, taking advantage of new developments and technologies as they became available.</p>
<p>Beats are probably one of the oldest homosexual institutions; a way of meeting others for sex and (sometimes) socialising when other opportunities are not available. Wotherspoon, in his history of gay Sydney <hi rend="i">City of the Plain</hi> has commented that homosexuals have been</p>
<quote><p>imaginative in creating other uses for a range of institutions established by the dominant culture, be they hotels, restaurants, cafes, baths or dressing sheds. This has been necessary since the ways in which heterosexuals can meet each other openly are not available to homosexuals. But one of the more contentious uses of society's institutions relates to the use, as a beat, of those generally ugly but ubiquitous facilities: public toilets. It is contentious not only because of the alleged nuisance problem, and alleged danger to minors, but also because it involves the issue of 'public' &#x2013; and multiple partner &#x2013; sex, notions that parts of our society find distasteful ... [F]or many male homosexuals, public toilets provided a venue for both fast anonymous sex and also &#x2013; and more than just occasionally &#x2013; a place where one could simply meet others of one's own kind ... [W]hile many people may find the notion utterly repugnant, it should be pointed out that if society denies access to legitimate meeting places for a minority, that minority simply develops its own meeting places, often by subverting institutions of the dominant culture.<note xml:id="fn37-87" n="10"><p><hi rend="sup">10</hi>Garry Wotherspoon, <hi rend="i">City of the Plain: history of a gay subculture</hi>, Sydney: Hale and Iremonger, <date value="1991">1991</date>, p. 68.</p></note></p></quote>
<p>Evidence of beats in Melbourne can be found as far back as the <date value="1860">1860s</date> when various urinals (particularly that on the corner of Swanston and Lonsdale streets &#x2013; in operation from the <date value="1860">1860s</date> to the <date value="1990">1990s</date>) and laneways in the city (Star Alley, off Little Bourke street) were the subject of police interest.</p>
<p>By the <date value="1920">1920s</date> and '<date value="1930">30s</date>, there was a well-established network of beats and cruising areas around the city, ranging from public toilets, to parks, laneways and stretches of city streets, where men would meet, strike up conversations, 'suss' each other out and
<pb xml:id="n23" n="23"/>
then adjourn to somewhere more private, such as a hotel, flat or boarding house, for sex. Some of the more popular park beats were the Fitzroy, Carlton and Flagstaff Gardens, although the Treasury Gardens were known to work as well. South of the Yarra, Alexandra Gardens, the Botanic Gardens, and the now-vanished Snowden Gardens (on the site of Hamer Hall) were all well known. Further afield, the wharves along the southern bank of the Yarra (where the Melbourne Exhibition Centre now stands) and the main Victoria Docks area were also sites of activity.</p>
<p>Melbourne's web of laneways also offered opportunities for sexual encounters. Around midnight on a Saturday in <date value="1925-03">March 1925</date>, wharf labourer James Gore was discovered in a darkened doorway of a warehouse in Wright's Lane in the central city with his trousers around his knees and his 'person' in the 'fundament' of Selwyn Lindsay, an actor. Later in court, the two denied doing anything wrong; Gore said he had stepped into the doorway to answer a call of nature, whilst Lindsay explained that he had bought a new pair of braces that day and was in the process of adjusting them as they were too tight. The pair maintained that neither was aware of the other's presence in the doorway until a suspicious night watchman shone his electric torch on them. The court chose to believe the watchman's story, particularly after a powder puff with rouge was found in Lindsay's pocket. Lindsay swore that the puff was a necessary piece of his professional kit, which he had put in his pocket without thinking in the rush of his packing when leaving his last engagement in Wonthaggi two days previously. The jury was not convinced and both men were found guilty and sentenced to 15 months hard labour at Pentridge.<note xml:id="fn38-87" n="11"><p><hi rend="sup">11</hi>Trial of James Gore &amp; Selwyn Lindsay, Public Record Office of Victoria, <hi rend="c">Vprs</hi>30 Criminal Trial Briefs, <date value="1925">1925</date>/230.</p></note> Most of the outdoor beats worked best at night under the cover of darkness (efficient sodium lighting of parks and streets was not to be introduced until the <date value="1950">1950s</date>), but indoor beats in public toilets and urinals could function at any time of the day.</p>
<p>Fifty-six year old, Scottish-born seaman, John Smith, decided to spend a day in <date value="1921-03">March 1921</date>, trying his luck at a couple of central city beats. He started his morning in the toilets at the Bijou Theatre Arcade in Bourke street where he was observed masturbating by Dennis Dunn, a city businessman. Dunn rebuffed Smith's suggestion of a mutual tug and so Smith left and wandered up Bourke street to the Eastern Markets to investigate the situation there. Having no luck in the toilets at the Market, he headed back to the Bijou where he found a willing Frederick Boscher, a printer's assistant. The outraged Dunn, however, had followed Smith from the Bijou to the Eastern Market and then back again to the Bijou and on the way approached a policeman, telling him what was going on. Dunn and the cop burst into the cubicle where Smith and Boscher had secreted themselves and both were arrested. Boscher, with the help of a clever barrister, managed to convince the court that he had just arrived as Dunn and the policeman turned up, but Smith was caught (dare we say it?) with his pants down and ended up with six months.<note xml:id="fn39-87" n="12"><p><hi rend="sup">12</hi>Trial of John Smith &amp; Frederick Boscher, Public Record Office of Victoria, <hi rend="c">Vprs</hi>30 Criminal Trial Briefs, <date value="1921">1921</date>/204.</p></note></p>
<p>Many men picked up other men on the street, particularly in the crowded streets of the central city; Bourke Street, Lonsdale Street and outside the busy Flinders Street Railway Station all feature in criminal trial records of the period. Princes Bridge was another popular pick-up spot; a busy thoroughfare, it was also close to the darkness of
<pb xml:id="n24" n="24"/>
Alexandra Gardens. The footpath along St Kilda Road was popular for the same reason. By far the majority of police prosecutions of consenting adult men for gross indecency and indecent assault were the result of men being found engaging in sex in public places. Many of the men arrested at beats were married, or had nowhere else to go, but it may have been that others were attracted to beats by the frisson of danger and thrill attendant on public sex.</p>
<p>Of course not all homosexual men used beats to meet others. Discrete friendship groups operated during the period, as they had before the Great War and continue to operate up to the present. Although some men were introduced to established friendship groups through others they had met at beats or on the street, still others revolved around men who were connected with amateur theatrical groups, church groups or mainstream social organisations. We know less of these groups than we do of beats, as they were less likely to arouse police and public suspicion and have therefore left little in the way of public records such as trial briefs. Nonetheless, sensational newspaper articles point to some clandestine gatherings in the <date value="1920">1920s</date> and '<date value="1930">30s</date>. <hi rend="i">Truth</hi> sent an intrepid reporter to a basement in East Melbourne in <date value="1932-10">October 1932</date> to uncover the truth about the 'Queer Exotic Cults' which were in the process of invading Melbourne.<note xml:id="fn40-87" n="13"><p><hi rend="sup">13</hi>'Queer Exotic Cults Invade Melbourne', <hi rend="i">Truth</hi>, <date value="1932-10-08">8 October 1932</date>, p. 8.</p></note> <hi rend="i">Truth's</hi> man on the scene reported a darkened basement with men dressed as women and women dressed as men and strange music being played in the smoky den. Other parties might be more sedate, whilst others were definitely outrageous. In <date value="1938-06">June 1938</date> police raided a party held in private rooms above a cafe in Elizabeth street: 'A licensing police raid on June 4 disclosed an amazing scene in lavishly appointed apartments behind the dull facade of a little Elizabeth street cafe. Dozens of men, many dressed as women, milled about two "cocktail bars", extraordinary notices were scattered here and there, and a cardboard sign directed the way to higher apartments where there was a luxuriously appointed bedroom littered with women's clothing and make-up'.<note xml:id="fn41-87" n="14"><p><hi rend="sup">14</hi><hi rend="i">Truth</hi>, <date value="1938-06-25">25 June 1938</date>, p. 15.</p></note></p>
<p>The use of a cafe's facilities for a private party points to the continued importance of cafes and coffee shops as places for homosexual men to meet. The development of a mature hotel and restaurant culture was hindered in many parts of Australia, including Melbourne, by six o'clock closing of public bars which was enforced from <date value="1916">1916</date> to the <date value="1960">1960s</date>. Although some hotels were known to tolerate quiet groups of homosexual men who would gather in one part of the bar, a great deal of camp (and straight) socialising took place in cafes, tearooms and coffee shops. The first reference in the press to a camp presence in a Melbourne tearoom was in <date value="1908">1908</date> when three young men dressed up as women and had tea at the stylish Vienna Cafe in Collins Street. They were arrested on a charge of creating a public nuisance and fronted the dock still dressed in their finery. When they explained that the stunt was done as a dare, the judge replied that they must either be sexual perverts or darn young fools.<note xml:id="fn42-87" n="15"><p><hi rend="sup">15</hi>'The Female Impersonators &#x2013; McKail, Ogilvie &amp; Page Before the Court &#x2013; Ball for ' Girls Only' Their Alleged Objective', <hi rend="i">Truth</hi>, <date value="1908-12-05">5 December 1908</date>, p. 5.</p></note></p>
<p>During the <date value="1920">1920s</date> and '<date value="1930">30s</date>, several coffee shops and cafes opened which welcomed a camp clientele. Among the largest of these was Tait's in the basement of the Manchester Unity Building. When it opened in <date value="1932">1932</date> it could seat a couple of hundred customers
<pb xml:id="n25" n="25"/>
and on Saturday nights was known as being host to a large, noisy and quite visible camp crowd. <hi rend="c">Byo</hi> sly grog was the order of the night, with customers smuggling their own booze into the cafe and drinking it out of tea cups! Further up the street was 'Cinderella's', a one woman show run by an elderly lady who dressed each night in a rusty black evening gown and hand-picked those who would gain entrance to the cafe from the crowd gathered at the door. She apparently had a knack for picking out the gays and lesbians in the waiting queue and ushering them in for a convivial evening of tea and raisin toast; the toaster and urn were hidden behind a curtain at the rear of the shop.</p>
<p>A few years earlier, the Austral Cafe in Exhibition Street, gained some notoriety for offering services beyond those normally offered by a cafe. One day in <date value="1926">1926</date>, 18 year old Ernest Pollard, a labourer, visited the cafe to have his shoes cleaned by the resident shoe shine, Fred Lee. Fred took young Pollard into the back room of the cafe and there gave him oral sex. Pollard later told Police 'He knelt down in front of me and started to brush my trousers. He then ripped open my fly and grabbed my hands pushing me against the table. He then started sucking my penis. I said 'Let me go!' He laughed. He kept on sucking my penis for some little time. He let me go after I spent in his mouth. I went out of the shop and told the first Constable I saw.'<note xml:id="fn43-87" n="16"><p><hi rend="sup">16</hi>Trial of Fred Lee, Public Record Office of Victoria, <hi rend="c">Vprs</hi>30 <date value="1926">1926</date>/168.</p></note> If Pollard was the first person to complain of Fred's extra services, how many regular customers were inconvenienced when Fred went to Pentridge for three months?</p>
<p>Beats and other meeting places, friendship networks and discretely welcoming commercial establishments such as cafes and coffee shops, are all examples of institutions which had been in existence prior to the Great War and continued to be part of homosexual life during the <date value="1920">1920s</date> and '<date value="1930">30s</date>. There were, however, new developments in camp life as the post-war years unfurled.</p>
<p>Among the most striking examples of modern life which many homosexual men turned to their advantage were the growing numbers of inner suburban blocks of flats, the dramatic rise in the number of motor vehicles on the roads and the spread of telephones. Flats are particularly important in the shaping of a modern homosexual subculture in the interwar period: 'In a country like Australia, where the most common domestic unit is the nuclear family, and the most common housing stock the detached bungalow owner-occupied by the nuclear family, flats and boarding houses provided one of the few situations where people could escape family and peer-group pressure, and live their lives as they wanted'.<note xml:id="fn44-87" n="17"><p><hi rend="sup">17</hi>Wotherspoon, p. 71.</p></note></p>
<p>The first flats had appeared in Melbourne just prior to the Great War. In an attempt to attract well-heeled tenants, these early flats set out to be socially exclusive, offering restaurants, in-house catering, accommodation for servants. By the early <date value="1920">1920s</date>, however, flats had become more egalitarian; smaller, self-contained and, most importantly for many people, anonymous. Before flats became common, the usual form of non-family accommodation for young males was boarding houses. These could range from the 'strictly supervised suburban boarding house, with 'prayers before meals', to the far more casually managed institution, the latter often being in inner city areas where there was a
<pb xml:id="n26" n="26"/>
larger transient population. Another factor affecting the style of the boarding house was neighbourhood attitudes, and here once again the nature of the inner-city areas meant that less conformity was expected than in the outer suburbs'.<note xml:id="fn45-87" n="18"><p><hi rend="sup">18</hi>Ibid, p. 70.</p></note> Flats allowed middle-class homosexuals the opportunity to move out of family homes and boarding houses and establish private lives for themselves; to entertain friends and lovers without having to explain themselves to landladies or parents and without the fear of their movements and visitors being noted by suspicious third parties. Flats also allowed homosexuals to host private parties, thereby making the flats of friends and acquaintances accessible to those men who weren't able to afford a flat of their own.</p>
<p>Large nineteenth-century mansions in formerly exclusive inner suburbs such as South Yarra and East Melbourne had already been cut up into rooming and boarding houses by the time of the Great War. Their gardens were ripe for subdivision and were soon covered with double-storey blocks containing four or six flats in a range of architectural styles from Olde English to Spanish Mission and Art Moderne. These suburbs, together with St Kilda, a popular bayside resort with a shifting population and a risqu&#x00E9; reputation, became the centre of Melbourne's 'flatland'. Flats gained a reputation as being, at best, bohemian and, at worst, serious dens of sin and iniquity. As early as <date value="1921-04">April 1921</date> <hi rend="i">Truth</hi> asserted that 'Melbourne's flatland' was infested with 'Curious Creatures &#x2013; Painted and Powdered Effeminates'.<note xml:id="fn46-87" n="19"><p><hi rend="sup">19</hi>'Curious Creatures &#x2013; Painted and Powdered Effeminates &#x2013; Is There an 'Intermediate Sex'? &#x2013; Something Needed to Protect the Young from Perversion', <hi rend="i">Truth</hi>, <date value="1921-04-19">19 April 1921</date>, p. 7.</p></note> Ten years later, investigating a robbery at a luxurious flat in East Melbourne, police were</p>
<quote><p>Amazed at the surroundings in which they found themselves . . . Persian rugs, incense holders, great beaten brass gongs were mingled with easels, paints and many works of art &#x2013; statuary, pictures and curios of outstanding merit . . . While they were there, some young lads arrived. Their appearance also interested the police and as a result of questioning, a very serious charge was preferred against Lewis [the resident of the flat]. This charge arose from his alleged relations with the young men.<note xml:id="fn47-87" n="20"><p><hi rend="sup">20</hi>'High Caste Indian Mystery Man &#x2013; Suicided After Serious Charge', <hi rend="i">Truth</hi>, <date value="1931-08-01">1 August 1931</date>, p. 9.</p></note></p></quote>
<p>By the eve of the Second World War, the connexion of homosexuals with flats was so well established in the minds of the tabloid-reading public that all that was required were a few key terms and the newspapers could assume their readers would be able to read between the lines. Reporting the suicide of American singer and composer Jack Dale in <date value="1939-01">January 1939</date>, newspaper headlines screamed 'Swing Band Musician Dead in St Kilda Flat &#x2013; &#x00A3;70 Week Star Whistler's Queer Note Before End'. <note xml:id="fn48-87" n="21"><p><hi rend="sup">21</hi>'Swing Band Musician Dead in St Kilda Flat &#x2013; &#x00A3;70 Week Star Whistler's Queer Note Before End', <hi rend="i">Truth</hi>, <date value="1939-01-21">21 January 1939</date>, p. 11.</p></note> The note next to Dale's body read ' To whom it may concern &#x2013; and I'll bet that's plenty', (It stated there were three people who had mattered in his life and without them, he could not see what he had to live for) 'I lost one of them by death, one of them by marriage and the other by my own unfaithfulness', continued the note. 'With their inspiration I feel I could have reached the top of the tree, but now I cannot go on.'<note xml:id="fn49-87" n="22"><p><hi rend="sup">22</hi>Ibid.</p></note> The combination of the St Kilda flat, the 'Queer' note and the lack of pronouns in the reporting of the three people referred to by Dale in his suicide note were enough for <hi rend="i">Truth's</hi> readers to draw conclusions.</p>
<p>Another aspect of modernity that homosexual men took advantage of during the interwar period was the motor car. The number of motor vehicles on the streets of
<pb xml:id="n27" n="27"/>
Melbourne increased dramatically; in <date value="1919">1919</date> there were 12 646 cars on Victorian roads<note xml:id="fn50-87" n="23"><p><hi rend="sup">23</hi>'The Triumphal Car', <hi rend="i">Argus</hi>, <date value="1919-10-15">15 October 1919</date>, p. 6.</p></note> and the number increased each year, until by <date value="1938">1938</date> there were over 215 000 private and commercial vehicles registered or about one car for every ten people in the state.<note xml:id="fn51-87" n="24"><p><hi rend="sup">24</hi>'More Cars in State', <hi rend="i">Argus</hi>, <date value="1938-01-06">6 January 1938</date>, p. 4.</p></note> The car, and the motorcycle, allowed mobility as never before. For those who could afford it, ownership of a car allowed the freedom to travel around town and out of town without having to rely on public transport or shank's pony. 'Cars helped revolutionise the recreational activities of many people. They could travel more easily within the city and for picnics or to the holiday homes which were springing up in the Dandenongs and at beach resorts within driving distance of Melbourne.'<note xml:id="fn52-87" n="25"><p><hi rend="sup">25</hi>Garden, p. 341.</p></note> No longer would a young man at a dance dismiss an attractive girl from a distant suburb not easily reached by public transport as 'G.I. &#x2013; geographically impossible'.<note xml:id="fn53-87" n="26"><p><hi rend="sup">26</hi>'The Cars that Ate Melbourne', <hi rend="i">Age</hi> <date value="2004-02-14">14 February 2004</date>.</p></note> And what goes for young men with an interest in girls also applies to young men with an interest in other young men.</p>
<p>Since the <date value="1920">1920s</date>, society's moralisers had been warning about the impact of the motor vehicle. For example, in <date value="1935">1935</date> the Bishop of Bendigo, in an article 'The Car Conquers the Cradle', had criticised young married couples for putting off having children, to enable them to save money to buy a car: 'What also happened ... was that cars became, in effect, "mobile bedrooms" for the young'<note xml:id="fn54-87" n="27"><p><hi rend="sup">27</hi>Wotherspoon, p. 147.</p></note> with the car providing a degree of privacy for those without any other place to go. Sometimes, you didn't even have to own a car to take advantage of one; around 11pm on the evening of Monday <date value="1927-05-16">16 May 1927</date>, 30 year old Myer's department manager, Russell Luke, left the King's Theatre after seeing Judith Anderson in 'The Green Hat' and walked down Swanston Street to Flinders Street where he met 21 year old Stan Clark, a taxi driver employed by the Yellow Cab Company, standing by his cab at the Princes Bridge Station taxi rank.<note xml:id="fn55-87" n="28"><p><hi rend="sup">28</hi><hi rend="i">Argus</hi>, <date value="1927-05-16">16 May 1927</date>, p. 20.</p></note></p>
<p>The two struck up a conversation about the warmth of the evening and 'Clarke then said, indicating a stationary electric train in Princes Bridge Station, 'The train's nearly empty'. I [Luke] said 'Most people are at home I suppose'. Clark said 'Yes and not a bad place either'. I said 'Why? You must be married?' He said 'No, I wish I was I'd have somebody to go home to now'. I said 'Why, is that how things are?' Clark then pressed up against me and on looking down I saw that his trousers were bulging out in front at the fly. He said 'Which way do you live?' I told him and he said 'I'll be going along that way as the rank is pretty full and I think I'll move'. I said 'You can drive me to Domain Road'. <note xml:id="fn56-87" n="29"><p><hi rend="sup">29</hi>Trial of Russell Luke &amp; Stanley Clark, Public Record Office of Victoria, <hi rend="c">Vprs</hi> 30 Criminal Trial Briefs, <date value="1927">1927</date>/349.</p></note></p>
<p>The two drove to Domain Road where, according to Clark:
<quote><p>I drove up Domain Road to opposite the Botanical Hotel and Luke said "Now turn to the left, and to the left again and stop". I then turned my taxi into the Govt House Domain and opposite Park Street South Yarra and turning west drove towards the wireless station.</p>
<p>Luke then said "Pull up". And I stopped my cab on the right hand side of the road through the Domain. I then got out of my cab on the right hand side and opened the door of the cab. Luke said "What do I owe you?" I said "four and threepence". He then gave me two two shilling pieces a sixpence and two threepenny bits &#x2013; five shillings in all &#x2013; and handed it to me. He then said "Hop in here". I got in the cab beside him and sat there a few minutes.</p></quote></p>

<p>It was the arrival of the Constable which ensured that Luke and Clark's evening adventure was recorded for posterity; the two were charged with committing an act of gross indecency with each other and ended up with sentences of three months (Clark) and nine months (Luke).</p>
<p>Of course, car ownership was nowhere near as widespread as it was to become in the <date value="1950">1950s</date> and '<date value="1960">60s</date> and was largely restricted to the middle class. This meant, however, that homosexual men in possession of a car could turn this to their advantage in picking up younger, or poorer, men. The relative rarity of a car meant that many lads would quite willingly go for a spin; in <date value="1933">1933</date> Alan Barr, a commercial traveller for a pharmaceutical company invited Stan Hickman, a shop assistant working at an Armadale chemist shop to go for a drive with him; they ended up parked at the railway reserve near Tooronga Station,<note xml:id="fn58-87" n="31"><p><hi rend="sup">31</hi>Trial of Alan Barr, Public Record Office of Victoria, <hi rend="c">Vprs</hi>30 Criminal Trial Briefs, <date value="1933">1933</date>/632.</p></note> whilst in <date value="1939">1939</date> Melbourne doctor Robert Storer was found 'parking' in his car with his office boy at the Studley Park Golf Course.<note xml:id="fn59-87" n="32"><p><hi rend="sup">32</hi>'Dr Storer Arrested in Studley Park', <hi rend="i">Truth</hi>, <date value="1939-09-16">16 September 1939</date>, p. 14.</p></note></p>
<p>For those without a car, public transport continued to be the main means of getting around the city; trains, cable trams and buses. The Victorian Railways were upto-the minute; the first metropolitan line (Essendon to Sandringham) was electrified in <date value="1919-05">May 1919</date>; within five years the entire metropolitan service had been converted from steam to electricity, and the cable tram system was converted to electricity between <date value="1924">1924</date> and <date value="1940">1940</date>. Flinders Street Railway Station, the hub of the metropolitan system and in the heart of the city, handled millions of passengers each year; in <date value="1923">1923</date>/<date value="1924">24</date> there were 157 969 687 suburban railway journeys undertaken in Victoria.<note xml:id="fn60-87" n="33"><p><hi rend="sup">33</hi>'Railway Finances &#x2013; Surplus for Year', <hi rend="i">Argus</hi>, <date value="1924-09-04">4 September 1924</date>, p. 9.</p></note> A great many of these would have passed through Flinders Street Station and out under the clocks into the city.</p>
<p>'Under the clocks' at Flinders Street Station became one of Melbourne's key meeting points, and homosexual men made as much use of the Station as other members of the public; at 8:15 on a <date value="1925-06">June night in 1925</date> 45 year old painter Ernest Casey met 18 year old lensmaker James Moore on the footpath outside Flinders street. 'How's about a stuf [sic]' he said to the lad and the two boarded a train heading for St Kilda. They got off at the station and headed into the darkness of the Albert Park Reserve. The two had sex in the park without attracting any attention and afterwards, decided to head to Fitzroy Street, St Kilda for something to eat. On leaving the reserve they attracted the attention of two police officers in Fitzroy Street whose attention was drawn by the grass stains and damp condition of the knees of young Moore's trousers! Under questioning by the police the story came out and Casey found himself charged with buggery. Moore was not charged, as due to his age and having been the one who was buggered, was seen by the courts as being the victim &#x2013; albeit a willing one.<note xml:id="fn61-87" n="34"><p><hi rend="sup">34</hi>Trial of Ernest Casey, Public Record Office of Victoria, <hi rend="c">Vprs</hi>30 Criminal Trial Briefs, <date value="1925">1925</date>/420.</p></note></p>
<p>Train station lavoratories also operated as a beat during the <date value="1920">1920s</date>; around 6:35pm on <date value="1929-11-23">23 November 1929</date>, Harold Porter, by all appearances a fairly obvious 'quean' was discovered on his knees in a lavatory cubicle giving Thomas Dillon oral sex. The
<pb xml:id="n30" n="30"/>
attendant alerted two of the Victorian Railways Special Inquiry Officers who arrested the pair. When interrupted Dillon said to the arresting Officer 'It is a pity you did not come along a couple of minutes later I would have blown off. It was lovely.'<note xml:id="fn62-87" n="35"><p><hi rend="sup">35</hi>Trial of Harold Porter &amp; Thomas Dillon, Public Record Office of Victoria, <hi rend="c">Vprs</hi>30 Criminal Trial Briefs <date value="1929">1929</date>/917.</p></note></p>
<p>Suburban trains also gave homosexual men a chance to meet each other.

<p>Telephones, although not a new piece of technology (the Melbourne exchange dated from <date value="1880">1880</date>), were another modern convenience which homosexual men took advantage of. The relative prosperity of the <date value="1920">1920s</date> made the phone a necessary requirement for businesses and the number of home and public phones increased as well. Australian figures give some indication of the rise in subscribers over the period; in <date value="1920">1920</date> there were 205 262 phones connected in Australia,<note xml:id="fn64-87" n="37"><p><hi rend="sup">37</hi>'Postal Department: The Year's Transactions', <hi rend="i">West Australian</hi>, <date value="1921-04-15">15 April 1921</date>, p. 6.</p></note> by <date value="1939">1939</date> this number had increased to 674797.<note xml:id="fn65-87" n="38"><p><hi rend="sup">38</hi>'More Telephones', <hi rend="i">Argus</hi>, <date value="1939-12-18">18 December 1939</date>, p. 9.</p></note></p>
<p>The telephone allowed immediate, and perhaps just as importantly for homosexual men, relatively private communication possible, particularly after the staged introduction of automatic exchanges began in Melbourne in <date value="1914">1914</date>.<note xml:id="fn66-87" n="39"><p><hi rend="sup">39</hi>'Brighton Exchange: Official Enquiry: "Satisfactory on the Whole"', <hi rend="i">Argus</hi>, <date value="1914-07-22">22 July 1914</date>, p. 13.</p></note> Letters and other mailed items carried the risk of falling into the wrong hands; in <date value="1919">1919</date>, Lance McWilliam and Charlie Scott, two men who had been conducting an affair for a number of months were found out when a letter that Lance had written to 19 year old Charlie was opened by Charlie's mother.

<p>By the eve of the Second World War Melbourne was a major city of over one million people; economic recovery after the Great Depression was obvious, the skyline was bristling with new commercial blocks and offices and new wonders including neon signs and the city's first multi-storey car park (built <date value="1939">1939</date>). The suburbs had stretched out in 'a blazing and monotonous expanse of red brick and terracotta roof that has flowed over the hills and valleys to the east like lava, and leaked slowly in an ever lengthening arc right round the eastern shore of Port Phillip Bay twenty-five miles to Frankston'.<note xml:id="fn70-87" n="43"><p><hi rend="sup">43</hi>Graham McInnes, <hi rend="i">The Road to Gundagai</hi>, London: Hamish Hamilton, <date value="1965">1965</date>, p. 61.</p></note> Melbourne still had its reputation for provincial staidness, but the seismic upheaval of the coming War, with the threat of invasion, mass mobilisation of the population for the war effort and the 'American Invasion' which saw well over two-hundred-thousand U.S. servicemen and women pass through Melbourne in a two year period, would change the city forever.</p>
<p>The <date value="1920">1920s</date> and '<date value="1930">30s</date> mark the emergence of a modern homosexual subculture in Melbourne, at very much the same time as in other major cities around the world. This development was assisted in large part by the development of modern ways of living and technologies which allowed homosexual men access to privacy, mobility, immediate communication and built on existing institutions and ways of life of the subculture. Building on these developments, the subculture would continue to mature during the War years and into to the post-War period, setting the scene for the social and political changes of the <date value="1960">1960s</date> and beyond.</p>

<p><hi rend="c">As Early as</hi> <date value="1868">1868</date>, the Block on Collins Street's north side, stretching from Elizabeth to Swanston Street, was fashionable: 'ablaze with its crowds of colonial fashionables and celebrities . . . passing the hour in an easy, careless, lounging, gossipy manner'. Whilst 'doing the block' on Saturday mornings, middle-class Melbourne showed that it was the best dressed in Australia.<note xml:id="fn71-87" n="1"><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi>I gratefully acknowledge Gary Jaynes' generous help in researching this article.

<p>Back then, the most desirable place to be seen in Melbourne was Caf&#x00E9; Gunsler on the Block, later known as the Vienna Caf&#x00E9;. In <date value="1916">1916</date> it was remodelled as the splendid, spacious Caf&#x00E9; Australia, and in <date value="1927">1927</date> became the Australia Hotel. In <date value="1939">1939</date> this was demolished and replaced by the larger, glamorous Hotel Australia, some of whose bars immediately became the most popular meeting place in Melbourne for homosexual ('camp') men,<note xml:id="fn72-87" n="2"><p><hi rend="sup">2</hi>Gary Simes, <hi rend="i">A Dictionary of Australian Underworld Slang</hi>, South Melbourne, Vic.6: <hi rend="c">Oup</hi>, <date value="1993">1993</date>, pp. 37-38. In Australian slang, 'camp' came to mean homosexual. This was different from in the <hi rend="c">Uk</hi> and North America, where, from <date value="1918">1918</date>, it generally meant ostentatiously and effeminately homosexual, or queeny. There, 'to camp' was to behave in the manner of an outrageous queen, or to flaunt one's homosexuality.</p></note> particularly the Collins Street first floor cocktail bar and the basement public bar, which from <date value="1970">1970</date>-<date value="1980">80</date> became the Woolshed. In <date value="1992">1992</date> the Hotel Australia and an adjoining hotel were demolished and replaced by Australia on Collins. This site has a significant architectural history in which creative women played a strong role, but after briefly tracing its development, I want to explore the much less known experiences and memories of its gay clientele, mainly from <date value="1930">1930</date>-<date value="1992">1992</date>, as far as evidence allows.</p>
<p>Most of the rich experiences of gay men recounted in this article were concealed from the community and straight historians at least until the <date value="1970">1970s</date>, and even today. Most of the gay men whose stories are quoted here seem to have led happy lives and did not feel oppressed, but they knew the limit of their behaviour, without exposing themselves and their friends to risk. So describing their lives openly for the public record was risky. Aberrant lives are known from court records, but until <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> oral history interviews, the social experience of ordinary lesbians and gay men in Melbourne before about <date value="1980">1980</date> remained systematically unexplored. For instance, although it describes other underworlds and minority behaviour, Andrew Brown-May's <hi rend="i">Melbourne Street Life</hi>, published in <date value="1988">1988</date>, only once mentions homosexuality, and that as a nuisance in public urinals.<note xml:id="fn73-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi><hi rend="i">The Encyclopedia of Melbourne</hi> (see following note) and <ptr target="http://www.emelbourne.net.au"/> redresses this with three lesbian and gay-related entries, although its entry for the Hotel Australia does not mention its gay cultural histories.</p></note></p>
<p>There is only the slightest evidence of whether the Caf&#x00E9; Australia, or the pre-war Prince of Wales supported a gay culture, or even that one existed in private.<note xml:id="fn74-87" n="4"><p><hi rend="sup">4</hi>There are some suggestions of a possible gay culture in oral history interviews done by the <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> but they are somewhat vague and inconclusive.</p></note> Other than the legal records and <hi rend="i">Truth</hi>'<hi rend="i">s</hi> prurient histrionics, the earliest evidence of generalised gay social life is from c.<date value="1930">1930</date>, from the gays born during the Great War who lived long enough and were courageous enough to record their memories on tape.</p>

<p>Oral history interviews can take us back as far as living memory allows (to about <date value="1930">1930</date>). Before that often the only information about unconventional behaviour we have comes from court records. On <date value="1908-09-22">22 September 1908</date>, Alan McKail (aged 20), Douglas Ogilvie (22) and Tom Page (25) were charged with behaving indecently in a public place, Collins Street. They were dressed as women in the Vienna Caf&#x00E9;. Page and Ogilvie worked for the Melbourne Steamship Company, whilst McKail was 'well connected', had &#x00A3;500 a year and trained as a fashion designer in Paris. The judge said 'they were either sexual perverts, or damn young fools; that the difference between male and female apparel was one of the cornerstones of civilisation and no one could be allowed to flaunt that convention'.<note xml:id="fn77-87" n="7"><p><hi rend="sup">7</hi>'The Female Impersonators &#x2013; McKail, Ogilvie &amp; Page Before the Court &#x2013; Ball for "Girls Only" Their Alleged Objective', <hi rend="i">Truth</hi>, <date value="1908-12-05">5 December 1908</date>, p. 5, with line illustrations of the three men.</p></note></p>

<p>Both upstairs and downstairs were good pick-up bars, with lots of people who knew each other.<note xml:id="fn118-87" n="48"><p><hi rend="sup">48</hi>'Geoffrey' interviewed by Graham Willett, <date value="2001-02-20">20 February 2001</date>, <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>.</p></note> But there was a clear divide between the two crowds. Upstairs didn't explicitly exclude anyone, but those who were 'a bit rough' wouldn't want to go upstairs, be thought 'piss elegant,' and feel uncomfortable with people in suits. 'Martin' didn't like the upstairs bar, 'full of <hi rend="c">Tq</hi>s [travel industry queens] and <hi rend="c">Wd</hi>s [window dressers]' and, as Russell Grant recalled, theatre people from the Princess, Comedy and Her Majesty's.<note xml:id="fn119-87" n="49"><p><hi rend="sup">49</hi>Russell Grant, born <date value="1948">1948</date>, interviewed by Graham Willett, <date value="2005-01-27">27 January 2005</date>, <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>.</p></note> Upstairs queens generally wouldn't be seen downstairs, so would seek butch trade elsewhere.

'Trade' in the <hi rend="c">Uk</hi>, invariably means prostitution, but in Australia, whilst it may mean that, it also means potentially attractive and available 'lower class' gay men. 'Beat' in Australia means a place, usually a public toilet, known for potential homosexual sexual encounters.</p></note></p>
<p>But there was some crossover. From about <date value="1946">1946</date> Roderic Anderson would go every Saturday afternoon 'looking for rough trade'. The 'upstairs bar was . . . piss-elegant queens', but downstairs, 'butch types'. Yet it was at the Snakepit that he first met Alan Swinburne, dressed in the 'camp uniform of reefer jacket, grey trousers, paisley cravat and suede shoes'. Perhaps typically of the camp world, they remained friends for 35 years, with Alan opening doors for Roderic to a more sociable camp life and new experiences in food and drink.<note xml:id="fn121-87" n="51"><p><hi rend="sup">51</hi>Roderic Anderson, <hi rend="i">Free Radical: a memoir of a gay political activist</hi>, [Caboolture, <hi rend="c">Qld</hi>] : The Author, <date value="2006">2006</date>, pp. 74-75.</p></note> (Mayhead recalls the <date value="1960">1960s</date> camp 'uniform' as: Old Spice, pale pastel pullover, khaki shorts, and long socks.)<note xml:id="fn122-87" n="52"><p><hi rend="sup">52</hi>Gerald Mayhead interview.</p></note></p>
<p>In the <date value="1960">1960s</date>, the downstairs bar was open at lunchtime too, operated by two German sisters, who had been in Hitler Youth. Jewish customers would reveal their numbers to them, but they were not embarrassed, and they were understanding of their camp customers. The cinema manager, brother of an early director of Channel 2, was also camp.<note xml:id="fn123-87" n="53"><p><hi rend="sup">53</hi>Ibid.</p></note></p>
<p>On Saturdays friends would meet and go there, or to the London Hotel to find where the party was that night, and if you were 'a young thing', you'd be included. James remembers that he'd press his suit, 'till you could hardly walk . . . Hair all oiled and that nonsense'. '[Y]ou wouldn't dare ask for a gin and tonic there. You could only drink . . . fancy drinks . . . upstairs. The barmaid would tell you to fuck off, they didn't mince words'. He would wear a leather jacket, t-shirt and jeans, and 'play the room . . . you'd go there and have a drink, and speak to no-one all night, until you were leaving, and someone would want to drag you away, never having dropped a spangle all night'.'Mark' liked downstairs for the 'Dagos'. 'All those Greeks and Italians who left mama and the kids back in Italy or wherever, and were working hard at the Snowy River. They'd come down with these raging horns, and I was waiting for them!' He laughed: 'I was cementing Australian-Italian relations'.<note xml:id="fn124-87" n="54"><p><hi rend="sup">54</hi>'Mark' and 'James' interview.

<head>The Woolshed</head>
<p>On Anzac Day <date value="1970">1970</date>, a couple of days after I returned from my honeymoon, a strikingly remodelled Snakepit reopened, re-named the Woolshed.<note xml:id="fn145-87" n="75"><p><hi rend="sup">75</hi>Around <date value="1972">1972</date>, the self-descriptor term 'camp' was, somewhat reluctantly in Australia, replaced by the American word 'gay', initially for both men and women.</p></note></p>
<p>In <date value="1968">1968</date> Fred Matear died and by <date value="1970">1970</date> his son Bruce was Managing Director. He and his wife Judy planned the bar while on a tour of woolsheds, and Pauline Faulkiner opened it. The Faulkiners were grazing pioneers with sheep stations in the Riverina, and their ram was depicted on the Australian shilling. There were beautiful people at the launch: Matear intended to make the bar attractive &#x2013; the kind of place a fellow could take his lady, to be companionable and attractive to women, like an English pub. Mixed company, conversation and the expense of buying drinks for two, could reduce alcohol consumption.<note xml:id="fn146-87" n="76"><p><hi rend="sup">76</hi>Gerald Mayhead interview.</p></note> Matear might have hoped the bar's new rural theme would attract women, but the butch theme was immediately fashionable for cruising gay men, military personnel and Western District cockies alike.<note xml:id="fn147-87" n="77"><p><hi rend="sup">77</hi>'Louis' born <date value="1924">1924</date>, interviewed by Geoffrey Stewardson, <date value="2001-07-09">9 July 2001</date>, <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>.</p></note></p>
<p>The bar's entrance from Collins Street appeared to descend into a mineshaft. The d&#x00E9;cor consisted of electrified hanging kerosene lanterns, rough-sawn timbers, corrugated steel roofing, boxes stuffed with straw bales and 'Nigretta East J.H.M.' wool bales to sit on. Walls were decorated with large black and white photographs of shearing and <hi rend="c">Ras</hi> ribbons, timber tables projected from walls and others were barrels. The seating was hessian covered, and a squarish island bar replaced the two facing bars.</p>
<p>For gay men, the Woolshed's competitors were the Graham, Young &amp; Jackson's, Hosies', the London, the Elizabeth, the Oasis Sauna, and Maisies which had a cocktail bar next door, with its own gay customers. One weekly 5.30 pm ritual was Mondays: Maisies, Tuesday: Prince, Wednesday: Australia, and only on Friday: the Windsor's discreet corner bar.<note xml:id="fn148-87" n="78"><p><hi rend="sup">78</hi>Francesca Curtis interview.</p></note> Just as a group of camp friends in the late <date value="1950">1950s</date>, feeling reluctant to be seen at the Australia, might meet for Friday night drinks at non-camp hotels: the Royal Arcade, Menzies and the Windsor,<note xml:id="fn149-87" n="79"><p><hi rend="sup">79</hi>Robbie, born <date value="1946">1946</date>, interviewed by Lucy Chesser, <date value="2007-03-29">29 March 2007</date>, <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>.</p></note> Francesca recalled that in the late <date value="1940">1940s</date> and 50s: 'We dined with friends at the Saracen's Head and the Hotel Australia when women weren't allowed into public bars'.

It did not exclude them, but public bars generally did not welcome women. On Friday and Saturday nights many would continue on to John Barry's Union Hotel, Fenwick Street, North Carlton, and later the University Club, Collins Street. The Woolshed was closed on Sundays and many went to Blades (later Annabelle's, now Comme), Alfred Place, where there was drag and supper to comply with the <hi rend="i">Licensing Act</hi>, but it was hard to find another licensed premise open on Sunday.</p>
<p>Michael Casley visited the Woolshed from <date value="1974">1974</date> and recalls most bar staff being female: one was Fiona, Eurasian and 'very, very beautiful', and a couple of others, then in the final eighteen months, a 'lovely guy called Eric who was gay, but not overtly'. Even
<pb xml:id="n42" n="42"/>
then, most entered the bar from the basement, to make it less obvious. Michael recalls management as extremely tolerant, quite accepting, but keeping their distance. The manager was quite short, with an English accent and a pinstripe suit, but rarely worked the bar. Michael remembers window dressers from Myers and Buckley &amp; Nunn's (now David Jones) regularly there, particularly at lunchtime. He recalls a friendly bar, never any fights, and generally a pleasant place 'amongst your own', though he doesn't think a lot of pick-ups occurred. Around <date value="1976">1976</date> they installed a jukebox. About that time, my straight brother Stephen often went to the Woolshed alone, and to the upstairs bar with a female friend, although 'never noticed the gay element . . . but perhaps that was due to the time of day I was there'. <note xml:id="fn152-87" n="82"><p><hi rend="sup">82</hi><hi rend="i">Campaign's Melbourne Gay Guide, <date value="1978">1978</date></hi>.

<p>After almost ten years, the Woolshed, 'the best known meeting place for gay people' in Melbourne, closed permanently on Saturday <date value="1979-09-08">8 September 1979</date>.<note xml:id="fn154-87" n="84"><p><hi rend="sup">84</hi>'Ben', born <date value="1916">1916</date>, interviewed by Mark Riley, <date value="2001-07-04">4 July 2001</date>, <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>.</p></note> By then the place had deteriorated and the management had become hostile to the gay hand that fed them. Staff were given only two days notice of the closure. Notoriously, during that final evening, police arrested Terry Stokes and Darren Turner outside the bar in Collins Street, for kissing. The Melbourne Magistrates' Court convicted them of offensive behaviour on 5 October.<note xml:id="fn155-87" n="85"><p><hi rend="sup">85</hi>Claude Forrell, <hi rend="i">Age</hi>, <date value="2010-04-25">25 April 2010</date>.</p></note> Later at the same spot, two women initiated a 'Kiss-In' protesting against that arrest, but by then the police were no longer offended, and a photograph of that 'scandal' of Jamie Gardiner and Alan Hough kissing appeared in the <hi rend="i">Age</hi> on 10 October. The Woolshed basement was said to have been sealed over, some even whispered it had been filled in with concrete.</p>
<p>Some of the Woolshed's camp clientele, including my partner Geoffrey Peterson-Wright and myself, continued to meet after work in the Hub Bar, where occasionally drag queens drifted in, or even to the rough Royal Arcade Hotel (built c.<date value="1910">1910</date>), in Little Collins Street, which had, from <date value="1959">1959</date>, been the first meeting place of a camp group, later called The Boilers: now the longest running gay social group in Victoria.

<head>The Laird</head>
<p>On <date value="1980-09-28">28 September 1980</date>, just over a year after the Woolshed closed, and the day after the Richmond and Collingwood Grand Final, a redecorated Laird O'Cockpen Hotel, Gipps Street, Abbotsford was opened by Ron Watkin as manager, with his partner David Allen. Unlike the Woolshed, it specifically targeted gays. It had a front bar for locals, a restaurant, a gay back bar decorated with a masculine rural theme, two roaring log fires and another in a 44-gallon drum in the courtyard, which they planted with an
<pb xml:id="n43" n="43"/>
elegant Sugar Gum sapling. Some say it was derived from the famous Eagle Tavern in San Francisco, but the Eagle opened a year later than the Laird. A fortnight later, Geoff and I walked there. Its d&#x00E9;cor was so reminiscent of the Woolshed, almost a reincarnation: natural materials, bench-seating, rural and industrial memorabilia. I recall a long conversation with a friendly barman. In <date value="2010-09">September 2010</date>, the Laird celebrated its 30th anniversary: the second oldest gay bar in Melbourne. Perhaps the Woolshed should also have been remembered: it would have also been 40 years old.</p>
<p>In <date value="1987">1987</date> the Matears sold the Australia to concentrate on the Dorchester in Alexandra Gardens they'd owned for fifty years and Allison's Restaurant (now Jacques Reymond) in South Yarra.<note xml:id="fn157-87" n="87"><p><hi rend="sup">87</hi><ptr target="http://www.walkingmelbourne.com/building647_hotel-australia.html"/>.</p></note> Over <date value="1988">1988</date>-<date value="1992">92</date> the Australia and Royal Arcade Hotels were demolished<hi rend="sup">88</hi> and replaced by Australia-on-Collins, designed by Buchan Group Architects in gaudy Post-modernism, opening in <date value="1992-10">October 1992</date>.

<div xml:id="t1-g-t5-body-d1">
<p><hi rend="c">In</hi> <date value="1970-05"><hi rend="c">May</hi> 1970</date> I lived outside Springwood in the Blue Mountains to the west of Sydney. I recall listening to a radio broadcast of a massive anti-Vietnam war demonstration. 100 000 people were marching up Bourke Street in Melbourne. The war moratoriums were national. It was about that time I fell in love with a man. We were, I said, just 'people', and he happened to be male. I doubt at that point I had ever heard the word 'gay', and I did not know that some homosexuals in Australia referred to themselves as 'camp'. Nor had I ever been to a bar where homosexuals congregated, though I think I had heard rumours about the Albury in Oxford Street, but maybe that was later.</p>
<p>I did know a little about opposition to the Vietnam War, the counter culture ('hippies') and the American civil rights movement. I saw <hi rend="i">Hair</hi> in the Metro Theatre, Kings Cross in <date value="1969">1969</date>, and, in I think the same venue, maybe two years later, I watched a double bill of films: <hi rend="i">Boys in the Band</hi> and <hi rend="i">Fortune in Men's Eyes</hi>. <hi rend="i">Boys in the Band</hi> dramatised the lives of nine homosexual men at a birthday party. <hi rend="i">Fortune in Men's Eyes</hi> depicted a version of life for men in prison. I was riveted. Identification quickly became a politics. Homosexual acts were illegal in every state and territory in Australia, and aversion therapy was in its heyday.</p>
<p>The gay and women's gay liberation movements gave a dramatic new political impetus to what was already occurring. The Australian chapter of the lesbian organisation Daughters of Bilitis had been founded in Melbourne in <date value="1970-01">January 1970</date>; though small and not well known, there was <hi rend="c">Tv</hi> and newspaper coverage.<note xml:id="fn158-87" n="1"><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi>Liz Ross, 'We were Catalysts for Change', <hi rend="i">Journal of Lesbian Studies</hi>, vol. 13, no. 4, <date value="2009-10">October 2009</date>, pp. 442-460.</p></note> Public lesbian and gay politics changed nationally with the formation of the Campaign Against Moral Persecution (<hi rend="c">Camp</hi>) in Sydney in September.<note xml:id="fn159-87" n="2"><p><hi rend="sup">2</hi>On <hi rend="c">Camp</hi> and on the seventies generally, see Denise Thompson, <hi rend="i">Flaws in the Social Fabric: homosexuals and society in Sydney</hi>, St Leonards, <hi rend="c">Nsw</hi>: Allen and Unwin, <date value="1985">1985</date>; Garry Wotherspoon, <hi rend="i">City of the Plain</hi>: <hi rend="i">history of a gay sub-culture</hi>, Sydney: Hale and Iremonger, <date value="1991">1991</date>; Graham Willett, <hi rend="i">Living Out Loud: a history of gay and lesbian activism in Australia</hi>, St Leonards, <hi rend="c">Nsw</hi>: Allen and Unwin, <date value="2000">2000</date>; Clive Moore, <hi rend="i">Sunshine and Rainbows: the development of gay and lesbian culture in</hi></p></note> Society Five, Melbourne's version of <hi rend="c">Camp</hi>, formed in <date value="1971">1971</date>. The shock and excitement of open, self-accepting homosexuality provided by media coverage of <hi rend="c">Camp</hi> was followed by reviews of Dennis Altman's <hi rend="i">Homosexual: oppression and liberation</hi> (<date value="1971">1971</date>) in <hi rend="i">Time</hi> magazine in <date value="1972-02">February 1972</date>, the <hi rend="i">Age</hi> in July and the <hi rend="i">Australian</hi> in August. <hi rend="i">Altman's book</hi> documented and articulated a militant 'gay' politics that refused secrecy and shame while also challenging activism that only worked within 'the system'. The television series <hi rend="i">Number 96</hi> also began in <date value="1972">1972</date>. One character was Don Finlayson, an openly homosexual lawyer.</p>
<p>Activists were not born radicals. Often enough it was the activity and bravery of others that provided personal impetus. In an obituary of one time seminarian John Vergona (<date value="1944">1944</date>-<date value="2009">2009</date>), journalist Mark Ellis wrote of how Vergona became one of the first people to come out in the media:
<quote><p>He said in the [<hi rend="i">Age</hi>, <date value="1972">1972</date>] article that he saw his work with Society 5 as helping people, much the same as he would have done had he become a priest ... He also appeared on the then Channel O's <hi rend="i">Dateline</hi> program, where his phone number
<pb xml:id="n45" n="45"/>
appeared on screen. There were a few nasty calls but mostly he was inundated with calls from people desperate to talk, with a high proportion from the country ... Vergona knew he would lose his job at [a Catholic school] so resigned to avoid embarrassment to the school. He took to playing piano full-time, seven days a week, and promptly doubled his income. He moved to the Old Melbourne Hotel in <date value="1973-01">January 1973</date> and continued there for 20 years, a small record in casual music in Melbourne.<note xml:id="fn160-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi>Mark Ellis, 'Brave campaigner for some of society's most marginalised', <hi rend="i">Age</hi>, <date value="2009-09-25">25 September 2009</date>.

<pb xml:id="n46" n="46"/>
Oxford Street seeking a bar I had heard of called Cappriccio's. I had sought it before, but no-one had told me it was upstairs. That night I found it and after shakily making my way up the stairs I entered. It was loud with voices, somewhat dimly lit and there appeared to be very few men. I recall what seemed to be large breasted women with enormous round eyes, and elongated eyelashes in voluminous green satin or velvet. They were, I realised slowly, men. I fled. 'Cap's' drag shows were later referred to as 'legendary in Sydney's gay history', but any such sense was beyond who I was at the time.<note xml:id="fn162-87" n="5"><p><hi rend="sup">5</hi>Wotherspoon, <hi rend="i">City of the Plain</hi>, p. 158.</p></note> Others loved the drag shows that accompanied some parts of gay life.

<p>A while back, during a bout of insomnia mixed with vivid dreams when I did sleep, I woke from a dream where I had seen Ken, or 'Joe', as he liked to be known later in his life. In <date value="1972">1972</date>, Ken was celebrated in a piece of Carlton graffiti: 'Free Ken McClelland'. Like others, he had been imprisoned in Pentridge, as an anti-conscription draft resister to the Vietnam War. He had been taken by police from the classroom where he taught near Port Fairy. Ken was released soon after the Whitlam government was elected in December of that year.<note xml:id="fn163-87" n="6"><p><hi rend="sup">6</hi>A poster for a demonstration demanding Ken's release earlier in <date value="1975">1975</date> can be seen at <ptr target="mailto:http://vietnamwar.commemoration.gov.au/conscription/moratoriums-and-opposition.php"/> (accessed <date value="2010-07-30"><date review=" -01-30">30 July 2010</date></date>).

When I met him in <date value="1979">1979</date> in Clifton Hill, Ken was in the process of connecting with gay activists. In the early <date value="1980">1980s</date> he became a stalwart in the Victorian response to <hi rend="c">Aids</hi>, and the first convenor of the teams caring for people living with <hi rend="c">Aids</hi> north of the river. He died in his Northcote home in <date value="1992">1992</date>. The graffiti disappeared sometime later.</p>
<p>Pentridge was not foreign to gays. Noel Tovey, now an activist for indigenous rights, and a noted performance artist, ended up there at 17 after 'growing up in the slums of Carlton in the <date value="1940">1940s</date> and '<date value="1950">50s</date> ... and a police raid on a drag party in Albert Park'.<note xml:id="fn164-87" n="7"><p><hi rend="sup">7</hi>'Tovey or not Tovey', <hi rend="i">Age</hi>, <date value="2005-01-16">16 January, 2005</date>.</p></note> As did others, he left Australia for many years. Still others, like Brian Finemore, the country's first ever curator of Australian art at the National Gallery of Victoria, as Ian MacNeill put it, 'stayed and defied'. Finemore was murdered in his East Melbourne home in <date value="1975">1975</date>. Melbourne was 'shocked and scandalized' and the crime has never been solved.<note xml:id="fn165-87" n="8"><p><hi rend="sup">8</hi>Ian MacNeill, 'Brian Finemore', <hi rend="i">Art Monthly Australia</hi>, no. 183 (<date value="2005-09">September 2005</date>).</p></note></p>
<p>Joe's courage paralleled that of many activists. My friend Jude, from a good Salvation Army home, stood alone on Melbourne city intersections in about <date value="1971">1971</date> distributing a leaflet she had produced calling for decriminalisation.</p>
<quote><p>The stigma of being homosexual ... will continue to exist until public ignorance is changed to understanding and tolerance ...

<p>It was Jude who some years later pointed out to me the street where Brian Finemore

My boyfriend and I began to attend parties at the Camp Inc offices in Darling Street, Balmain, opposite the fire station, and university gay liberation dances. In hindsight, I am surprised at how we did not let our own fears hold us back in so much of what we did. For students like myself, universities were relatively safe places where liberal attitudes were dominant, and many were also part of the waves of <date value="1960">1960s</date> political radicalism that swept into the early years of the seventies &#x2013; the anti-war movement, women's liberation, black power, and Aboriginal demands for land rights.</p>

While I was involved in some of the events mentioned here, the essay is a hybrid collection of recollections. I mix my own reminiscences with those of friends and acquaintances, quotes from contemporary media commentary, books, articles, and websites. I also use materials and databases held in the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives.<note xml:id="fn169-87" n="12"><p><hi rend="sup">12</hi>See also the 'Living in the Seventies' issue of <hi rend="i">Australian Feminist Studies</hi>, vol. 22, no. 53, <date value="2007">2007</date>.</p></note> I seek to give a sense of some of what was occurring, the social and political relations between some gay men and lesbians, and a feel for how some people thought about what they were doing at the time or in hindsight.</p>
<p>Decades are not neatly contained ways to slice history or memoir or friendships. The seventies in this essay begin in <date value="1969">1969</date> with Stonewall and Jan Hillier's dances. They end with the fifth national homosexual conference in <date value="1979">1979</date> and the opening in <date value="1980">1980</date> of The Peel, Club 80, the Laird, Inflation, and Ryders. I wanted a critical 'feel' for what was occurring in those years, without closing-off 'the times' to the research that is still needed.</p>
<p>Jenny Brown wrote in the early seventies magazine <hi rend="i">William and John</hi> of Melbourne's camp dances:
<quote><p>By <date value="1970">1970</date> you could feel it. A surging, glistening, electric <hi rend="i">underground</hi> current. It sang a high tension hum behind the droning conversation in the hetero bars and discoteques [sic] ... an estimatable frustrated energy-force was bubbling toward a surface. Not all of us realised; it was the city's latent homosexuality on the rise.<note xml:id="fn170-87" n="13"><p><hi rend="sup">13</hi>Jenny Brown, 'Melbourne's Camp Dances', <hi rend="i">William and John</hi>, <date value="1972-12-07">7, December 1972</date>, pp. 7-8.

<p><hi rend="i">William and John</hi> described itself in the first edition in <date value="1972-01">January 1972</date> as a 'camp Australian magazine. We are homosexual and proud of it'. It was the first of eight issues. Used in this way 'camp' was a social identity rather than a specific sensibility ('that's camp') or mode of wit based in a celebration of artifice and theatricality, though they did often overlap. Camp was about to be supplanted by 'gay', an emerging politics of social identity that in its more radical forms also challenged how heterosexuality and gender were socially organised. In that sense gay liberation, like women's liberation, directed

itself toward radical social change through direct political challenge rather than to law reform.</p>
<p>The dances, dancing and venues Brown writes about involved for many participants their early if not first experiences of homosexuals <hi rend="i">en masse</hi>. They were dancing bodies. She positions the dances as part of the counter culture, avant-garde events that challenged mainstream dance and party culture. They were 'new'. The dances were organised by, directed to and primarily attended by, camp women and men, effectively reorganising the boundaries between public and private.</p>
<p>Brown wrote of two regular dances, 'Spangles', and 'Jan's Dance'. Jan was Jan Hillier who became a major entrepreneur in the Melbourne lesbian and gay bar scene, much as Dawn O'Donnell was in Sydney. 'Spangles' was a moveable dance not a fixed venue. It was held initially at the church hall on the corner of Punt and Toorak Roads until the church realised what they were hosting and pushed it out. 'It then moved to reception halls', she says:
<quote><p>The St Windsor Regis was one, a balconied 50's [sic] ballroom with wall to wall everything, and a liquor licence. Spangles <hi rend="i">bought</hi> the right to privacy, money whispered in the right ears ... it moved through Melbourne's reception-joints like gay lightening from Fitzroy St, St Kilda, back to Toorak Rd, to South Yarra and down on St Kilda's Esplanade again.</p></quote></p>
<p>The breathlessness of 'wall to wall everything' marvels at glamour and extravagance, at what was possible with money. 'Jan's Dance' provided competition for 'Spangles', sometimes on the same night. It too changed venues frequently. Spangles appears to have been mixed, was weekly on a Friday night, had a $2.50 entrance fee, ran to 2 or 2.30am and required easily gained private membership.</p>
<quote><p>They could even afford to forget advertising ... The camp market was a huge, largely uncatered for one, haloed by a nebulous throng of bi-sexuals, friends and joy riders ... the doors always overflowed, while Melbourne's two remaining discos, Berties and Sebastians,<note xml:id="fn171-87" n="14"><p><hi rend="sup">14</hi>Berties (<date value="1966">1966</date>-<date value="1973">1973</date>?) and Sebastians were Melbourne's two premier live music discoteques. Both were unlicensed. See <ptr target="http://www.milesago.com/venues/berties.htm"/>, (accessed <date value="2010-07-21">21 July 2010</date>).</p></note> seemed to have run out of soul and inspiration ... three medium sized camp venues in two weeks is nothing in a city of two million people.</p></quote>
<p>Brown uses Berties and Sebastians to contrast the newness of the camp dances as 'underground' forms of overtly homosexual socialising:
<quote><p>tight-knit knots of younger homosexuals dotting the city began to recognise each other and choose social gathering points &#x2013; mainly pubs. Their counted numbers grew erratically . . . The acceptance of camp social gathering-places made homosexuals realise just a fraction of their numbers; then private parties weren't enough; a private dance was next.</p></quote></p>
<p>The dances were being organised by people like Hillier who had often long been part of the camp scene. Garry Wotherspoon noted of Sydney that 'many of the major social events of the sub-cultures, particularly the parties and dances' were organised from within specific friendship networks, as were private homosexual clubs.<note xml:id="fn172-87" n="15"><p><hi rend="sup">15</hi>Wotherspoon, <hi rend="i">City of the Plain</hi>, pp. 134, 136-7. See also <ptr target="http://www.pridehistorygroup.org.au/"/> (accessed <date value="2010-10-23">23/10/2010</date>).</p></note> Brown implies, however, that many of the attendees were not from the private, domestic party networks amongst older homosexuals, but from wider disco dancing cultures. The private party

networks had allowed homosexuals to socialise in relative safety 'away from the public gaze',<note xml:id="fn173-87" n="16"><p><hi rend="sup">16</hi>Wotherspoon <hi rend="i">City of the Plain</hi>, p. 72.</p></note> but, in Brown's account, the dances drew on people who wanted 'camp socialgathering places'.</p>
<p>Sometimes the 'insider' influence was dismissed as involving the actions of elites but there are complications here. Police harassment was common, and bars sometimes operated in close relation with organised crime, especially, but I doubt only, in Sydney.<note xml:id="fn174-87" n="17"><p><hi rend="sup">17</hi>Craig Johnston, <hi rend="i">A Sydney Gaze: the making of gay liberation</hi>, Sydney: Schiltron Press, <date value="1999">1999</date>, pp. 64-67.</p></note> The bars, dances and cafes were regulated by liquor licensing, the illegality of male homosexual behaviour and limited social legitimacy.</p>
<p>Domestic parties were also part of student life. Jocelyn Clarke describes how in the early seventies, after she begins 'sleeping' with women, she</p>
<quote><p>became part of a group of lesbians who had a party every week at someone's house. I had little in common with these women; nonetheless I looked to them for my definition of a lesbian and hence my definition of myself.<note xml:id="fn175-87" n="18"><p><hi rend="sup">18</hi>Jocelyn Clarke, 'Life as a Lesbian', in Jan Mercer, ed., <hi rend="i">The Other Half: women in Australian society</hi>, Ringwood, Vic.: Penguin, <date value="1975">1975</date>, p. 335.</p></note></p></quote>
<p>In the process she began to doubt that 'lesbianism had to be concealed from everyone in the outside world except very close friends, [or] that it involved some playing of "butch" and "femme"'. Her doubts, however, did not take shape until she became involved in women's and gay liberation. I note that 'butch' and 'femme' came from lesbian bar cultures, and posed difficulties for some lesbian feminists.<note xml:id="fn176-87" n="19"><p><hi rend="sup">19</hi>See, Joan Nestle, ed., <hi rend="i">The Persistent Desire: a femme-butch reader</hi>, Boston: Alyson, <date value="1992">1992</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>In Clarke's account, socialising was associated with a re-forming of the self. Sometimes this was expressed as finding one's 'true' self,<note xml:id="fn177-87" n="20"><p><hi rend="sup">20</hi>See Reynolds, <hi rend="i">From Camp to Queer</hi>, chapters 5 and 6.</p></note> but it involved a straying from the self &#x2013; moving away from one's own conventional understandings of femininity, masculinity, and the values of institutionalised heterosexuality (marriage, children, monogamy). The paradox here is that extraordinary discipline was exercised in order to create a freer self in a different world. The pleasure was often in the passion of doing it together, forging a sense of a shared project, and often accompanied by headiness.</p>
<p>One demonstrator in a <date value="1972">1972</date> action against the <hi rend="c">Abc</hi>'s banning of a program on homosexuality carried a placard saying 'We're not fucked up, we're fucked over'.<note xml:id="fn178-87" n="21"><p><hi rend="sup">21</hi>Johnston, <hi rend="i">A Sydney Gaze</hi>, p. 19.</p></note> I recall another piece of (Fitzroy?) graffiti &#x2013; 'Break out, not down'.

<p>Maintaining equanimity as one rejects the exclusivity of romantic love, combats institutional power in all its forms and learns how to do politics was often messy, as well as radicalising, daunting, confusing and exhilarating. Robert Reynolds noted the utopian vision of liberation offered 'few guidelines on how to live in the present'.<note xml:id="fn179-87" n="22"><p><hi rend="sup">22</hi>Reynolds, <hi rend="i">From Camp to Queer</hi>, p. 105.</p></note> Sue Jackson, an early participant in women's and gay liberation is quoted as saying,</p>
<quote><p>What I think we were predominantly trying to do then was to live the postrevolution before we'd even figured out anything about what was even the structure of what we were living in, and how you might actually go about changing it.<note xml:id="fn180-87" n="23"><p><hi rend="sup">23</hi><ptr target="mailto:http://users.spin.net.au/~deniset/alesfem/qlespol.pdf"/>, accessed <date value="2010-07-29">29 July 2010</date>.</p></note></p></quote>
<p>Similarly, looking back in <date value="1980">1980</date>, Di Otto wrote in the <hi rend="i">Lesbian Newsletter</hi>,</p>
<pb xml:id="n52" n="52"/>
<quote><p>We make the mistake of assuming that lesbianism, in itself, is a radical position ... It is as ludicrous as believing that every working-class person is a communist.<note xml:id="fn181-87" n="24"><p><hi rend="sup">24</hi>Quoted in Ross, 'Escaping the Well of Loneliness', in Verity Burgmann and Jenny Lee, eds, <hi rend="i">Staining the Wattle</hi>, Ringwood, Vic.: Penguin, <date value="1988">1988</date>, p. 107.</p></note></p></quote>
<p>Just as many of the more politically active often distanced themselves from existing lesbian and gay cultures and politics, responses from 'the scene' to these new moves varied &#x2013; support, fear, suspicion, hostility. Melbourne's private parties, social groups and camp social scene still await extensive description. Parts of this milieu were, as Willett has said, 'cautiously public'.</p>
<p>Brown had a fine early eye for market potential, and what was later called the 'pink dollar'. What was less evident from her article was that there were groups that did not identify as camp, and that there were also non-commodity relations linking politics and socialising.</p>
<p>Just as some people moved between both politics and the scene, some men and women remained friends and others organised together. This 'mixed' politics was particularly evident in conference organising, in the work of the Gay Teachers and Students Group and the teachers unions around anti-sexism and homosexual teachers, in the campaigns in defence of Penny Short and Greg Weir and their right to train as teachers, in the production of <hi rend="i">Young, Gay and Proud</hi>, in the campaigns against Mary Whitehouse and fundamentalist Christian opposition to the legitimacy of homosexuality, and in the monthly production of <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>.<note xml:id="fn182-87" n="25"><p><hi rend="sup">25</hi>Willett, <hi rend="i">Living Out Loud</hi>, p. 137.</p></note> While women and men working together had its challenges, it did continue.</p>

<p>The move towards wider social acceptance was slow, but steady, though it was not always very visible in everyday life. Changing religious, political, legal and social attitudes were often masked by the more public activities of homophobes. One major arena of change involved interactions between gay and lesbian activists, feminists and the union movement, especially, but not only, the teachers' and social welfare unions. Shane Ostenfeld documents these interactions in detail, including how the Australian Women's Trade Union Conference in <date value="1976">1976</date> promoted the Working Women's Charter. It called for an end to discrimination 'on the basis of sex, race, country of origin, age, religious belief, appearance, marital status or sexual preference'. The Charter was adopted by the <hi rend="c">Actu</hi> in <date value="1977">1977</date>.<note xml:id="fn183-87" n="26"><p><hi rend="sup">26</hi>Shane Ostenfeld, 'Interactive Movements: Gay Lib, the Women's and Student Movements, and the Trade Unions', in Garry Wotherspoon, ed., <hi rend="i">Gay and Lesbian Perspectives III</hi>, Sydney: University of Sydney, <date value="1996">1996</date>, pp. 189-206.</p></note></p>
<p>The first Women's Liberation conferences took place in Melbourne in <date value="1970">1970</date> and <date value="1971">1971</date>. Much of the focus was on equal pay and women's right to work. Other women were critical, arguing that the role of the family under patriarchy (institutionalized male domination) needed much more attention to childrearing, domestic work, laws limiting abortion, taxes on contraception, access to education and control over their own bodies. Women's liberation was developing systematic critiques of gender, sex and relationships, but many lesbians began to question assumptions about heterosexuality within the women's movement. At the same, time, they questioned male sexism within gay liberation.</p>
<pb xml:id="n53" n="53"/>
<p>These matters have been discussed extensively. Several feminisms were involved, and lesbians were involved in all of them &#x2013; socialist feminism, radical feminism, lesbian separatism. Looking back in the later <date value="1980">1980s</date>, Liz Ross wrote,</p>
<quote><p>Lesbian separatism continued to be one of the major issues in lesbian politics. Lesbian separatism means the separate organizing of lesbian action groups, without either heterosexual women or gay men. I think that how lesbians organise, whether separately or not is a tactical question.<note xml:id="fn184-87" n="27"><p><hi rend="sup">27</hi>Ross, 'Escaping the well of loneliness', p. 103.</p></note></p></quote>
<p>Here Ross distinguished between lesbians who were also feminists, and a politically powerful separatist lesbian-feminism.</p>
<p>The first national lesbian feminist conference was held in Sorrento, outside Melbourne in <date value="1973">1973</date>. It was organised by Melbourne Radicalesbians &#x2013; 'an off-shoot of the Gay Women's Group which had come into existence within Gay Liberation'.<note xml:id="fn185-87" n="28"><p><hi rend="sup">28</hi>See Chris Sitka, 'A Radicalesbian Herstory'.

<p>The first national homosexual conference was held at Melbourne University in <date value="1975-08">August 1975</date>. It was probably at that point the largest political gathering of homosexual men and women ever seen in Australia. I came down from Sydney for the conference by train, just as others came from all over the country and moved down 'permanently' soon after. By then Gay Liberation House was in Fitzroy (Brunswick St, then Moor Street). In the first eighteen months I lived in group houses in North Fitzroy and North Carlton, then criss-crossed the river, still in group houses for several years, then shared with Jude, before settling by myself in St Kilda. The group houses were mixed: lesbian and heterosexual women and gay, and occasionally heterosexual, men. Feminism was a shared commitment, as were the politics of radical social change. Like many activists then, we identified as socialists and often as communists.</p>
<p>The first national conference involved both women and men, and was auspiced by the Women's Officer at the Australian Union of Students (<hi rend="c">Aus</hi>) but organised by an independent collective. <hi rend="c">Aus</hi> gave considerable impetus to women's and gay politics in the mid-seventies and later. It nourished local activists (Laurie Bebbington, Phil Carswell, Gary Jaynes, Jude Munro, Ron Thiele, Margaret Lyons, Steve O, Ken Howard) and brought others to Melbourne from interstate as office holders for periods of time

(Gaby Antolovitch, Jeff Hayler [<date value="1953">1953</date>-<date value="2006">2006</date>], Craig Johnston, Peter O'Connor, Gay Walsh). It had national clout through its structure and media, and its ability to run national campaigns amongst students. It was based in Drummond Street, Carlton.</p>
<p>The national conferences continued until <date value="1986">1986</date>, playing a key role in maintaining a national activist constituency.<note xml:id="fn191-87" n="34"><p><hi rend="sup">34</hi>Willett, <hi rend="i">Living Out Loud</hi>, pp. 122-127.</p></note> Liz Ross remarked that 'involvement in liberation movements is a very good education.'<note xml:id="fn192-87" n="35"><p><hi rend="sup">35</hi>Ross, 'Escaping the Well of Loneliness', p. 103.</p></note> Johnston argued that the conferences 'provided the movement with a national grass-roots network which has not been replicated since.'<note xml:id="fn193-87" n="36"><p><hi rend="sup">36</hi>Johnston, <hi rend="i">A Sydney Gaze</hi>, p. <hi rend="i">iv</hi>.</p></note> In the seventies he had argued that Gay Liberation ended organisationally in about <date value="1975">1975</date>, morphing into a 'movement'.</p>

<p>A friend recounts a <date value="1971">1971</date> visit to a lesbian bar south of the Yarra. She cannot remember the name of the bar, but remembers she went with some of her friends at the time, including, she thinks, Barbara Creed. They were students at Melbourne University, feminists and lefties. I look at lists of gay and lesbian bars in the early <date value="1970">1970s</date> and it seems probable that they went to the Imperial Hotel in Chapel Street, South Yarra. I ring Barbara, reintroduce myself and tell her the friend's memory. Initially she cannot remember the bar either &#x2013; this is a call out of the blue about long ago times &#x2013; but when I mention the possibility of the Imperial she thinks it is the most likely: 'It was on the left side, down Chapel Street. I can visualise a few women in a long, narrow bar'. We talk about the times. Barbara refers to the Gay [Liberation?] Centre in Davis Street, Carlton, which predated Gay Liberation House in Fitzroy. Barbara believes the Centre began in the living room of a house she co-rented. Amongst the participants she mentions Peter M, Ross M, Simon K, Harriet, Kaye M, Jess M, Jim, possibly Jude Munro and Ron Thiele. 'We had a consciousness raising group.' 'Mixed [female and male]?', I ask. "Yes', she replies. In <date value="1974">1974</date> Barbara wrote and directed <hi rend="i">Homosexuality: a film for discussion</hi> for schools. It was widely distributed and attacked.</p>
<p>Peter Williams talks in a similar way of going to Maisies at Her Majesties Hotel on Toorak Road in about <date value="1971">1971</date>: 'it was ten o'clock closing, and we'd find out where the party was that night. The address would go round the bar. If that failed', said Peter, 'you could always trawl Toorak Road after the pub closed'.</p>
<p>Jan Hillier ran mixed dances from the late <date value="1960">1960s</date> to about <date value="1973">1973</date> (initially in Richmond), as did Society Five (<date value="1971">1971</date>-<date value="1983">1983</date>) and Gay Liberation. The Society Five events were part of a weekly drop-in. Women's Liberation ran dances for women, and in <date value="1972-09">September 1972</date>, the Women's and Gay Liberation groups at Melbourne University organized Sexual Liberation Day 'including a public meeting, street theatre, discussion groups and a dinner dance'. The dance was cancelled 'after ugly scenes erupted between gay libbers and science education students'.<note xml:id="fn194-87" n="37"><p><hi rend="sup">37</hi>Graham Willett, 'From Camp to Gay.

<pb xml:id="n55" n="55"/>
<p>For all this, hours and options for public socialising were restricted. Peter Langford wrote in <date value="1975">1975</date> that 'night life in Melbourne finishes at 11.30pm except for the coffee scene'.38 This partly explains the attraction of the weekly Society Five drop-in nights. At this point the biggest concentration of venues (3-4 at a time) was in the city. Gary Jaynes notes that some of the bar owners particularly Max Poyser (Isabellas, the University Club) gave access to the Homosexual Law Reform Coalition during the <date value="1976">1976</date> election to talk with patrons, and for a public meeting in <date value="1977">1977</date>. In the early seventies, Women's and Gay Liberation dances were announced in the newsletters for those on mailing lists.</p>
<p>It was not until the mid and later seventies that venues could advertise extensively. In the later seventies, as the number of gay and lesbian bars and clubs increased, along with gay media, marketing and advertising also increased. Melbourne venues were first listed extensively in <hi rend="i">Campaign</hi>,<note xml:id="fn195-87" n="39"><p><hi rend="sup">39</hi>Peter C.

Much still depended on word of mouth, and the development of a critical mass of people prepared to attend them. This process accelerated, arguably, with the opening of Pokeys, and the various bars in the Chevron Hotel.</p>
<p>My own gay friendship networks were political. I knew almost nothing of bar life. That changed only a little after I moved to Melbourne (the Union Hotel, the University Club). My memory says that the Key Club was in Gertrude Street Fitzroy in the later <date value="1970">1970s</date>, and that it was a lesbian bar open on Sunday nights. You had to knock, and be looked-over through a slot that slid open in the door. Eyes scrutinised you, whether for familiarity, a 'look' or whatever, I do not recall. I raise the Key Club with Mitch, but she remembers things differently. She thinks the Key Club was mostly straight and had another name, that the lesbian night was Thursdays and maybe Sunday was a gay men's night. We are not sure of the detail. Memory does not get us there. This does not make it 'untrue', but it is vague, and as it turns out unreliable.</p>
<pb xml:id="n57" n="57"/>
<p>Mitch and I had met sometime in the later <date value="1970">1970s</date>, maybe at a party. She was a teacher. On occasion she and I spoke to students about gay liberation, once at <hi rend="c">Rmit</hi>, another time in Ballarat. We see each other still. That experience of friendship was common. It took many forms. David Menadue tells a story of his group of nine male friends in student housing at Melbourne University in the early seventies. They discovered they were all gay &#x2013; 'a shared experience that was to bond us for many years to come' &#x2013; and 'delved into a much more active exploration of the relatively hidden gay underworld that existed in Melbourne'.<note xml:id="fn202-87" n="46"><p><hi rend="sup">46</hi>More detailed research is required. The location and number of venues often changed. Gary Jaynes referred me to 'a map that was printed in <hi rend="i">City Rhythm</hi> for a period of about 18 months (issue #3, <date value="1982-02">Feb 1982</date> to #17, <date value="1983-08">Aug</date>/<date value="1983-09">Sep 1983</date>).

<p>I email Gary who has been associated with the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives in Melbourne since its beginning. (The Archives were founded at the fourth national Homosexual conference held in Sydney in <date value="1978">1978</date>.) I ask him what the Archives can tell me about the Key Club. He consults the holdings at the Archives and tells me the club opened <date value="1978-12-12"><date review=" -12-12">12 December 1978</date></date> and closed <date value="1989-06">June 1989</date>. The address was 22 Gertrude St, Fitzroy, in the Carlton Club Hotel. Mitch was partly right, and yes we did have to buzz. Neither of our memories had fully allowed for changes over fairly short periods of time. On Friday nights the bar for women was called Squizzies. In <date value="1979">1979</date>, operating as the Key Club, disco nights were Friday and Saturday. By <date value="1980-06">June 1980</date>, Thursday nights were 'girls only', Friday nights were 'mixed' and Saturday nights were for males.</p>
<p>Dave says on his website,
<quote><p>Fortunately, I "came out" in <date value="1978">1978</date>, and lived through an era when gay men did not have to feel any conflicts between their masculinity and being gay. There was a real brotherhood feeling back then. I remember one night in the "Key Club" in <date value="1979">1979</date>, it was very crowded and there was no room for dancing, So all the men took their shirts off, put their arms around one another and moved up and down to Patrick Hernandez's 'Born To be Alive'.<note xml:id="fn203-87" n="47"><p><hi rend="sup">47</hi>David Menadue, <hi rend="i">Positive</hi>, St Leonards, <hi rend="c">Nsw</hi>: Allen and Unwin, <date value="2003">2003</date>, pp. 32, 122.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>I note the reference to 'brotherhood' and the significance of music, in this case a disco classic, for the linking of communal togetherness with individualised selfexpression. A new gay culture was emerging, reclaiming some traditional aspects of masculinity and refusing to mask their relation to desire. Communality and desire did not, however, always sit easily together. Greater visibility of the leather subculture at this point challenged many, yet it was often there that some of the arguments about gay masculinity and shared understandings of community were positively articulated.</p>

<p>The growth of a more consolidated commercial scene (bars, saunas, shops of all kinds, media) enabled an experience of community. Pokeys (<date value="1977">1977</date>-<date value="1992">1992</date>), for example, was advertised in <hi rend="i">Campaign</hi> and the bar magazines.

<p>Hillier and Lucas approached the then hotel manager who doubted their claim that a drag show could fill the pub's entire first floor, including the main showroom, a long piano bar and the Regal Room. On the opening night of Pokeys only the showroom was made available; 300 customers were reputedly turned away.<note xml:id="fn207-87" n="51"><p><hi rend="sup">51</hi>'Prince of Wales Hotel', in <hi rend="i">A Place of Sensuous Resort.

<p>In <date value="1980">1980</date>, Rose had a male partner. She applied for a job in the newspaper for a casual barmaid at the Prince of Wales. She was 21. Some of her friends snickered when she told them where she was going to work. She did not know why.</p>
<quote><p>People were 12 deep at the bar for the entire shift in Pokeys. On other nights I worked in the adjacent piano bar. It was gay too, but in a different way, quieter, often older, and I liked Arthur who played the piano. He had a theatre background as a dancer I think, but was on the pension, and needed the job.

<p>It is almost impossible to overestimate the importance of this growth in open socialising made possible by the increase in commercial venues, ongoing activism and social tolerance. The combination had a direct affect on initially mostly gay male politics and over time on lesbian and eventually on what has become known as <hi rend="c">Glbt</hi> (gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender) politics. The pressure created led many activists to move away from 'movement' to a 'community' politics unthinkable in the early seventies. It also, however, brought people from the scene into activism.<note xml:id="fn209-87" n="53"><p><hi rend="sup">53</hi>'Prince of Wales Hotel'. The chapter provides no information on how these numbers were derived, though they possibly relate to takings based on a per head cover charge over the specified time period.</p></note> This in turn further strengthened demands for legalisation of male homosexuality, opposition to police raids
<pb xml:id="n59" n="59"/>
and harassment and a few years later, the organised response to <hi rend="c">Hiv</hi> and <hi rend="c">Aids</hi>. Much of the scene, if not 'community', is now taken for granted, as if it had always been there.</p>
<p>The Archives has posters advertising a Cabaret at the Pram Factory in Drummond Street, Carlton, <date value="1979-08-31"><date review=" -01-31">31 August 1979</date></date> and The Spring Follies Women's Dance at St Mark's Church Hall, on the corner George &amp; Moor Sts, Fitzroy, on 1 September. My first thought was these events had to do with the fifth national homosexual conference, held at the Universal Workshop in Victoria Street, Fitzroy, 31 August &#x2013; 2 September. It too had a gay dance on 1 September at Storey Hall, <hi rend="c">Rmit</hi>, featuring The Dots and The Kevins. In Liz Ross' account, she says, however, that 'there had been considerable debate about whether to run separate lesbian and gay male conferences. Eventually the Lesbian Action Group did organize separately'.<note xml:id="fn210-87" n="54"><p><hi rend="sup">54</hi>See Menadue, <hi rend="i">Positive</hi>, pp. 148-158.</p></note> David Menadue, who was also involved, gives a similar account.<note xml:id="fn211-87" n="55"><p><hi rend="sup">55</hi>Ross, 'Escaping the well of loneliness', p. 106.</p></note></p>
<p>The fifth conference arguably revitalized mixed gay and lesbian politics in Melbourne. (It was, however, probably the last time the 'movement' could speak with a loosely unified national voice.) The Victorian Gay Trade Unionists Group took-off (Alan Hough, Bruce Sims, Ken, Steve), and other links were made in the conference newsletter group between activists such as Gary Jaynes and newer participants like Danny Vadasz, Graham Willett, David Menadue and Alison Thorne. Together with others, including Pru Borthwick and Adam Carr, they produced <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi> (<date value="1979">1979</date>-<date value="1984">1984</date>). The second issue (<date value="1979-12">December 1979</date>) lists 19 people as production contributors.<note xml:id="fn212-87" n="56"><p><hi rend="sup">56</hi>Menadue, <hi rend="i">Positive</hi>, p. 150.</p></note> There were constant negotiations in <hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Gcn</hi></hi> over the 'commercial' aspects of the scene, sex and sexual objectification. Graham Willett has said that 'the debate about how the movement should relate to the sub-culture Was waged more intensely in <hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Gcn</hi></hi> than anywhere else'.<note xml:id="fn213-87" n="57"><p><hi rend="sup">57</hi>Willett, <hi rend="i">Living Out Loud</hi>, p. 210.</p></note> (<hi rend="i">Gay Information</hi> also made a major contribution to this debate after <date value="1980">1980</date>.) Melbourne activists, with the exception of some such as Phil Carswell, were arguably more uncomfortable with 'community' politics than many of their Sydney counterparts.</p>
<p>The networks which emerged, whether through participation in 'the scene' or in politics, along with the community media, and the growth in venues, enabled a mass coming out of gay men and lesbians. They also intersected, creating a strong awareness of civil rights amongst many lesbians and gay men. Together they made community: unity in difference.</p>

Forty years on, this decision taken at the dawn of the gay liberationist struggle in Australia speaks to the uneasy relationship between gay and lesbian politics and youth.</p>
<p>By <date value="1973">1973</date>, the caution exhibited by the Daughters of Bilitis gave way to the direct action of Gay Liberationists with activists organizing visits to schools. As Graham Willett has noted, the invitation from teachers to gay speakers to address high school classes in Melbourne on the topic of gay rights provoked widespread media coverage and political debate. Anti-gay politicians took up the notion of gay speakers in schools as reason enough to junk gay rights <hi rend="i">tout court</hi>, arguing that 'reform was opening the way for proselytizing among impressionable young people'.<note xml:id="fn215-87" n="2"><p><hi rend="sup">2</hi>Ibid, p. 95.</p></note></p>
<p>High schools were not the only site for the battle over education being waged between the authorities and gay and lesbian activists (and their allies). Campaigns at universities played a crucial role during this period as well. The exclusion of university student Jeremy Fisher from his residential college at Macquarie University for failing to renounce his homosexuality demonstrated the institutionalized desire to strictly police issues of homosexuality and students, even when those students were of adult age.<note xml:id="fn216-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi>See Jeremy Fisher, 'Into the light', <hi rend="i">Overland</hi>, <date value="2008">2008</date>, <ptr target="mailto:http://web.overland.org.au/previous-issues/issue-191/feature-jeremy-fisher/"/> (accessed <date value="2010-11-19">19 November 2010</date>).</p></note> The <date value="1973">1973</date>-<date value="1974">74</date> controversy over the decision taken by authorities in New South Wales that Penny Short was medically unfit to teach following the publication of one of her lesbianthemed poems<note xml:id="fn217-87" n="4"><p><hi rend="sup">4</hi>See Graham Willett, '"Proud and Employed": the Gay and Lesbian Movement and the Victorian Teachers' Unions in the <date value="1970">1970s</date>', <hi rend="i">Labour History</hi>, no. 76, <date value="1999-05">May 1999</date>, pp. 78-94. See pp. 80-81 for the discussion of Short.</p></note> is similarly indicative of the ways in which the administration of formal systems of schooling became a key process through which opponents of Gay Liberation organized to repudiate the political challenges brought forward by the Gay Liberation movement.</p>
<p>The public cases of Fisher and Short became totemic causes for Gay Liberationists and other groups in Australia organizing on the Left. That these issues drew support from a range of allies including socialists, trade unionists and feminists demonstrates not only the way in which public debates about homosexuality from the start of the activist era were concentrated on contests over the relationship between ideas about youth, education and sexuality, but also the way in which these contests in many ways represented a key battle line in Australian cultural politics more generally.</p>

Australian history of Fisher, Short and other high-profile episodes such as the Gay Teachers and Students Group, there has been little research specifically examining the history of youth, queer sexualities and education in Australia.<note xml:id="fn218-87" n="5"><p><hi rend="sup">5</hi>For example, see Gary Jaynes, 'Young, Gay and Proud: twenty years on', in Michael Crowhurst and Mic Emslie, eds, <hi rend="i">Young People and Sexualities: experiences, perspectives and service provision</hi>, Melbourne: Youth Research Centre, University of Melbourne, <date value="2000">2000</date>; Daniel Marshall, 'Young, Gay and Proud in Retrospect: sexual politics, community activism and pedagogical intervention', <hi rend="i">Traffic</hi>, no. 6, <date value="2005">2005</date>, pp. 161-187; and Steven Angelides, '"The Continuing Homosexual Offensive": sex education, Gay rights, and homosexual recruitment', in Shirleene Robinson, ed., <hi rend="i">Homophobia: an Australian history</hi>, Annandale, <hi rend="c">Nsw</hi>: Federation Press, <date value="2008">2008</date>.</p></note> The aim of this article is to take one example of a hitherto neglected episode in Australian <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> history &#x2013; the early gay youth group Young Gays &#x2013; as a way to begin a history concentrated on the intersections between ideas of youth, queer sexualities and education in Australia.<note xml:id="fn219-87" n="6"><p><hi rend="sup">6</hi>It would necessarily be a history of queer sexualities, and not gay and lesbian, because the range of activities, interventions and individuals involved in the anti-homophobic and anti-heterosexist work at the centre of such a history are not exhaustively and properly addressed by terms like 'gay', 'lesbian' or any other identitarian label. One example of this is the fact that some young people involved in queer youth groups eschew labels or identify as queer heterosexual 'allies'. This terminological volatility and definitional instability is an integral component to telling the history.</p></note></p>

<head>Young Gays (<date value="1979">1979</date>-<date value="1981">1981</date>)</head>
<p>After the advent of Gay Liberation, young people became involved in a range of Gay Liberation activities. The Gay Teachers and Students Group is one early example of youth involvement in gay political organising, although the numbers of young people involved in this group were never large. The Gay Teachers and Students Group was originally called the Gay Teachers Group and it was established in Melbourne in <date value="1975">1975</date>. The change of name reflected openness to young people joining the group as well as an acknowledgment of those students involved. This group spearheaded efforts to reform attitudes in relation to schooling and homosexuality by working with &#x2013; and seeking to influence &#x2013; teacher unions, politicians and the broader community. The group's legacy is perhaps most famously symbolized by its landmark <date value="1978">1978</date> publication <hi rend="i">Young, Gay and Proud</hi>.<note xml:id="fn220-87" n="7"><p><hi rend="sup">7</hi><hi rend="i">Young, Gay and Proud</hi>, Melbourne: Gay Teachers' and Students' Group, <date value="1978">1978</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>Distinct from anything that went before it, Young Gays emerged in <date value="1979">1979</date> as one of the first self-determining gay (by which it meant gay and lesbian) youth groups to successfully start up in Australia. Bill Calder, a former member, wrote a booklet on the group in <date value="1985">1985</date> &#x2013; <hi rend="i">Lavender Youth<note xml:id="fn221-87" n="8"><p><hi rend="sup">8</hi>Bill Calder, <hi rend="i">Lavender Youth: a history of Melbourne Young Gays Sep 79 &#x2013; Jan 81</hi>, [Melbourne]: The Author, <date value="1985">1985</date>. Hereafter <hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi> . This article focuses on Calder's account. The copy I used for this research is held in the <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> Ephemera Collection.</p></note> &#x2013;</hi> and this account forms the basis of the discussion here.</p>
<p>A workshop themed around the needs and interests of 'young gays' at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> National Homosexual Conference provided the impetus for forming the group.<note xml:id="fn222-87" n="9"><p><hi rend="sup">9</hi>The workshop was listed in the conference program as running from 2 &#x2013; 3pm Saturday September 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, in Room 19. See <hi rend="i">Newsletter of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> National Homosexual Conference</hi>, no. 6, p. 14.</p></note> The conference was held at the Universal Workshop, Fitzroy, Melbourne in <date value="1979">1979</date>.<note xml:id="fn223-87" n="10"><p><hi rend="sup">10</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, p. 5.</p></note> In <hi rend="i">Lavender Youth</hi>, Calder recalled that discussion amongst the young participants in this workshop revealed widespread levels of unhappiness over the way they felt their gay and lesbian adult counterparts were treating them. Calder recalls complaints being made about being ignored by older gays and lesbians (except when the older gay men wanted to have sex with the younger gay men) and about not being given meaningful work to do in the lead-up to the conference:
<quote><p>We're just here to do the shit jobs for them. Last week I spent a whole day cutting out pink triangles for name-tags. When I'd finished I asked someone if there was anything else I could do. He said there was nothing else unless I wanted to fold a couple of thousand leaflets. I thought "What a load of bullshit". There was six people there, all frantically working on designing things and writing things, yet obviously there was nothing suitable for me . . .' [Another speaker:] 'I think that's really terrible. They should be helping us to learn things, not just giving us the cruddy jobs. It's easy for them, 'cause they know it all. They've got jobs, houses, have come out . . . everything. Most of us are still stuck at home.<note xml:id="fn224-87" n="11"><p><hi rend="sup">11</hi>Ibid, p. 3.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<pb xml:id="n63" n="63"/>
<p>In Calder's account of the workshop, participants discussed the disadvantages they faced due to being at school and still living at home and they decide to start their own 'young gays youth group':
<quote><p>we can send info about homosexuality to schools plus organise parties and weekends away ... we could go out as a group to movies and things ... we could even just go out together to bars ... we should have them in every city of Australia. There's people here from Sydney, Adelaide, Canberra and I bet from other places too.<note xml:id="fn225-87" n="12"><p><hi rend="sup">12</hi>Ibid.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>The group decided it would be good to get 'money and things' from older gays but otherwise to run it 'on our own'. Consequently a motion was put to the conference by Alison Thorne. Timothy Conigrave recalls the moment in <hi rend="i">Holding the Man</hi>:
<quote><p>At the final plenary session, a confident young woman named Alison took the microphone and addressed the conference. 'We the newly formed Young Gays are disappointed by the lack of workshops dealing with our issues. Being young and gay in <date value="1979">1979</date> is probably easier than when you were coming out, but things are still difficult. Kids still get hassled at school, some attempt to take their own lives. Your attitude that we should have to deal with it because you did is patronizing, and not very community-spirited. Being young and gay is political. It forces people to confront adolescent sexuality. I hope our group can be strident enough to challenge the old theories about recruitment of the young.' Her motion of support for Young Gays was carried. Young Gays looked like being a formidable part of the gay community.<note xml:id="fn226-87" n="13"><p><hi rend="sup">13</hi>Timothy Conigrave, <hi rend="i">Holding the Man</hi>, Ringwood, Vic.: Penguin Books, <date value="1996">1996</date>. See pp. 133-134 for Conigrave's account of the Young Gays' motion. I am grateful to Gary Jaynes for bringing this reference to my attendtion.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>With the motion successfully passed, the group was given '$40 and some <hi rend="i">We're not all straight in the Garden State</hi> stickers to sell' from the conference.<note xml:id="fn227-87" n="14"><p><hi rend="sup">14</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, p. 5.</p></note> Melbourne Young Gays (hereafter Young Gays) first met on 'Saturday afternoon, <date value="1979-09-22">22 September 1979</date> in the Graduate Lounge, Melbourne University, and twenty-two young lesbians and gay men attended'.<note xml:id="fn228-87" n="15"><p><hi rend="sup">15</hi>Ibid.</p></note> By the end of the year, some members would report that the group boasted 'a floating population of eighty or so'.<note xml:id="fn229-87" n="16"><p><hi rend="sup">16</hi>Graham and Grant, Young Gays, 'Young Gays' [The Network], <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 1, no. 2, <date value="1979-12">December 1979</date>-<date value="1980-01">January 1980</date>, pp. 31-32.</p></note> At around this time the group adopted an age limit of 25 (although this was not uniformly enforced).<note xml:id="fn230-87" n="17"><p><hi rend="sup">17</hi>Young Gays, 'Dear <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>', letter, <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 1, no. 2, <date value="1979-12">December 1979</date>-<date value="1980-01">January 1980</date>, p. 30.</p></note></p>
<p>Young Gays came out of a
<quote><p>tradition of political activism and most of the young gay people who put energy into the group were committed politically to the gay liberation cause as well as other issues. Additionally all young gay people in <date value="1979">1979</date> confronted a hostile society. A society that not only induced guilt and denied them access to information and support, but one which was prepared to inflict aversion therapy or imprisonment on those who made love or simply expressed a desire to.<note xml:id="fn231-87" n="18"><p><hi rend="sup">18</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, p. 15.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>Calder says that these political motivations intermingled, somewhat uneasily, with the 'primary reasons for most being there': 'to cautiously come to terms with their own sexuality and find support, friends and lovers'. These diverse aspirations were 'very difficult' for a 'fledgling organization'.<note xml:id="fn232-87" n="19"><p><hi rend="sup">19</hi>Ibid, p. 16.</p></note></p>
<p>In <date value="1979-11">November 1979</date>, <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi> carried a column on the group:
<quote><p>'Young Gays' is mainly a social and support group. By its very existence, it happens to be a political group, unable to ignore inequality in the laws, education and other important issues.<note xml:id="fn233-87" n="20"><p><hi rend="sup">20</hi>'Young Gays', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 1, no. 1, <date value="1979-11">November 1979</date>, p. 11.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<pb xml:id="n64" n="64"/>
<p>It is virtually impossible to disentangle these entwined rationales for the group. In Calder's account, a diverse and often conflicting range of priorities, values and organizing styles played out during the life of the group, flowing from young people's various inclinations to lean more towards a political role for the group at the expense of social support and recreation, or vice versa. For Calder, these tensions played a key role in the group's eventual dissolution, foreshadowing the way in which debates over the purpose of queer youth groups would feature in public discussions about the groups that followed in the path of the Young Gays<hi rend="i"></hi>.</p>
<p>An early activity organized by the group was a camping trip to Warburton in rural Victoria.<note xml:id="fn234-87" n="21"><p><hi rend="sup">21</hi>The exact date is unclear, but based on other specified dates it seems that it occurred in <date value="1979-11">November 1979</date> and early <date value="1980">1980</date>; Calder refers to a trip that occurred during the 'summer of 77-80' but I assume this is meant to be <date value="1979">1979</date>-<date value="1980">1980</date>.</p></note> In Conigrave's recollection, the camp was held at a cottage that belonged to someone his parents knew:
<quote><p>After dinner the group decided to go into town to the pub. We found a corner near the fire, dragged a circle of chairs together and plonked ourselves down. I was aware that people were watching us. <hi rend="i">Perhaps it's the earrings and groovy haircuts. I guess they don't see boys with earrings much around these parts</hi>. After a few drinks the group became openly affectionate, sitting on knees, holding hands and kissing . . . A guy at the bar whose yellow T-shirt stretched over a beer belly walked over to Alison. 'Do you know your friends are poofters? Don't you think it's disgusting?' 'I'm a dyke, you deadshit.' He shoved her, she fell to the ground and he started kicking her. Alan and another guy from our group went to help her, but were swamped by men with moustaches and beerguts swinging punches. The wives stood on the sidelines trying to call them off.<note xml:id="fn235-87" n="22"><p><hi rend="sup">22</hi>Conigrave, <hi rend="i">Holding the Man</hi>, pp. 135-136.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>All the Young Gays eventually escaped although 'no-one assisted them' and one person required hospital treatment.<note xml:id="fn236-87" n="23"><p><hi rend="sup">23</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, p. 6.</p></note> Young Gays also took trips over the Summer of 79-80 to Daylesford and Lake Tyers.<note xml:id="fn237-87" n="24"><p><hi rend="sup">24</hi>Ibid, pp. 6-7.</p></note> The social events helped build the profile of the group and attendance at its regular Saturday meetings grew. However, Young Gays was forced to change venues for its meetings often and this negatively impacted on attendance levels (with communication of venue changes not always able to happen quickly enough in this pre-mobile telephone, pre-internet period).<note xml:id="fn238-87" n="25"><p><hi rend="sup">25</hi>'On the Move with Young Gays', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 2, no. 10, <date value="1980-12">December 1980</date>, p. 16.</p></note> This frequent change of venue reflects the unsteady and troubled access to resources that Calder identifies as impeding the long-term viability of the group.</p>
<p>Despite the limited access to resources, however, Young Gays quickly became a key organizing force in Melbourne's local gay and lesbian community. Young Gays contributed to the organizing effort in Melbourne for the <date value="1979">1979</date>-<date value="1980">1980</date> Summer Offensive for Gay Rights.<note xml:id="fn239-87" n="26"><p><hi rend="sup">26</hi>See Alison Thorne, 'Young Gays', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 2, no. 2, <date value="1980-03">March 1980</date>, p. 21.</p></note> The Summer Offensive was a national campaign launched at the <date value="1979">1979</date> National Homosexual Conference in the wake of widespread activism inspired by the series of arrests following the first Mardi Gras in Sydney in <date value="1978">1978</date>.<note xml:id="fn240-87" n="27"><p><hi rend="sup">27</hi>Willett, <hi rend="i">Living Out Loud</hi>, pp. 138-142.</p></note> In particular, they helped organise Gay Day celebrations at South Melbourne Beach, a protest march and a Gay Dance.<note xml:id="fn241-87" n="28"><p><hi rend="sup">28</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, p. 8.

<p>A range of other social events began to fill out the Young Gays calendar &#x2013; a progressive dinner departing from a Cecil Street address in Fitzroy, a 'Kiddies' party, a pool party, 'a very big Christmas party', and a 'fundraiser selling bric-a-brac at Camberwell Market'.<note xml:id="fn243-87" n="30"><p><hi rend="sup">30</hi>Ibid, pp. 8, 12.</p></note> During this time (the first quarter of <date value="1980">1980</date>), numerous sub-groups began to form under the broader Young Gays umbrella.

<quote><p>Our first match, on Friday <date value="1980-02-15">February 15 [1980]</date>, saw an untrained but enthusiastic team battle their way to their first loss.

<p>After a rare victory in July, management of Chaps &#x2013; a gay bar at the Chevron Hotel where the team would regularly have post-game drinks &#x2013; 'shouted Champagne all around'.<note xml:id="fn247-87" n="34"><p><hi rend="sup">34</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, p. 14.</p></note></p>
<p>The Young Gays Film Collective was another sub-group to emerge out of the larger collective.<note xml:id="fn248-87" n="35"><p><hi rend="sup">35</hi>'Young Gays Film Collective', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 2, no. 2, <date value="1980-03">March 1980</date>, p. 21.</p></note> It would meet every Tuesday evening:

We know that it's going to be provocative, but we need it to be eligible for a 'G' Classification so it has access to a large number of schools. Recent discussions have centred on the rationale for the film &#x2013; its impact on students, promotion of the 'ordinariness' of homosexuality, helping students to come out, and altering the ideas regarding stereotypes.<note xml:id="fn249-87" n="36"><p><hi rend="sup">36</hi>Michael Toucak, 'Young Gays' Corner: Film Collective', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 2, no. 5, <date value="1980-06">June 1980</date>, p. 5.

<p>The Young Gays who participated in this group prefigured the progressive turn towards community arts-based approaches in same sex attracted youth services developed two decades later. The film and theatre- based work of <hi rend="c">Y-Glam</hi> (<date value="1998">1998</date>-) provides perhaps the most well-known example of Victorian queer youth arts-based work, while such approaches are now being taken up by a variety of queer youth services, such as the involvement of <hi rend="c">Yak</hi>/Family Planning Victoria in the production of recent films <hi rend="i">Why's it called Gay?</hi> (<date value="2006">2006</date>) and <hi rend="i">Not So Straight</hi> (<date value="2010">2010</date>).<note xml:id="fn250-87" n="37"><p><hi rend="sup">37</hi>For further information about <hi rend="c">Y-Glam</hi> see Merri Community Health Services, Youth Health Team, <date value="2009">2009</date>, '<hi rend="c">Y-Glam</hi> Performing Arts Project', <ptr target="http://www.merrichs.org.au/Pages/YGLAM.aspx"/> (accessed <date value="2010-11-19">19 November 2010</date>).</p></note> The Young Gays Film Collective demonstrated a cultural inventiveness around notions of queer peer-topeer pedagogy that is only now beginning to be reflected in relevant policy and theory. Through such 'peer-to-peer pedagogy', by which refers to relationships of learning that occur between young people of similar ages, Young Gays represents a valuing of young people's agency which is still seen some thirty years on as cutting edge practice in many youth and education services.</p>
<p>In <date value="1980-02">February 1980</date>, members also tried to establish a Young Gays group in Geelong, driven in part by the experiences of some members who grew up outside of Melbourne.<note xml:id="fn251-87" n="38"><p><hi rend="sup">38</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, pp. 14, 27; 'Geelong Young Gays', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 2, no. 1, <date value="1980-02">February 1980</date>, p. 8. A month later, however, the group was encouraging young gays in Geelong to join the Geelong Male Homosexual and Lesbian support group instead of trying to establish a separate group (see Alison Thorne, 'Young Gays', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 2, no. 2, <date value="1980-03">March 1980</date>, p. 21).</p></note> Again, these efforts prefigure the future to come almost a quarter of a century later with
<pb xml:id="n67" n="67"/>
the establishment of regional same sex attracted youth groups such as WayOut, the Central Victorian Youth &amp; Sexual Diversity Project.<note xml:id="fn252-87" n="39"><p><hi rend="sup">39</hi>See WayOut History, WayOut Rural Victorian Youth and Sexual Diversity Project, 'WayOut History', <ptr target="http://www.wayout.org.au/WayOut/wayout-history.html"/> (accessed <date value="2010-11-19">19 November 2010</date>).</p></note></p>
<p>Further extending the queer peer pedagogical efforts represented by the aspirations of its film collective, Young Gays organized the distribution of information packs to high schools which included copies of the groundbreaking <hi rend="i">Young, Gay and Proud</hi> as well as copies of the leaflet: 'What to do when you meet a homosexual.' The pack included a covering letter urging the book to be placed on unrestricted loan in the library and offering to send speakers to schools. Some schools stocked the booklet and 'half a dozen speaking tours were organized'.<note xml:id="fn253-87" n="40"><p><hi rend="sup">40</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, p. 16.</p></note> In <date value="1980-03">March 1980</date>, Alison Thorne reported that:
<quote><p>[Young Gays'] collection of letters to school principals around the issue of <hi rend="i">Young, Gay and Proud</hi> are nearly ready to send off. We hope this collection, which comprises personal letters to our old principal and a cover letter explaining the purpose, will be well received.<note xml:id="fn254-87" n="41"><p><hi rend="sup">41</hi>Alison Thorne, 'Young Gays', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 2, no. 2, <date value="1980-03">March 1980</date>, p. 21.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>In addition to the high profile of the group in the range of political activities associated with the Summer Offensive in Melbourne, members participated in other demonstrations throughout <date value="1980">1980</date>, marching under the 'Young Gays are Proud' banner<note xml:id="fn255-87" n="42"><p><hi rend="sup">42</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, p. 15.</p></note> for workers' rights (May Day), women's rights (protesting at a Right To Life demonstration), nuclear disarmament, peace and the environment (an anti-uranium protest on Friday <date value="1980-10-03">3 October 1980</date> in the Treasury Gardens,<note xml:id="fn256-87" n="43"><p><hi rend="sup">43</hi>Ibid, p. 23.</p></note> and for Gay Equality (as part of the Homosexual Law Reform Campaign of <date value="1980">1980</date>).<note xml:id="fn257-87" n="44"><p><hi rend="sup">44</hi>Ibid, p. 16.

While the participation of Young Gays in these diverse political movements reflected a loose coalitionist expression of left politics that in many ways characterises dissident activism of the period, the involvement of the group in such a diverse range of political causes provides a historical point of comparison to the situation of queer youth groups and political activity today.</p>
<p>For Calder, Young Gays' 'most dramatic political action' was the Ashley's Boycott. Ashley's was a popular gay and lesbian venue in Smith St, Fitzroy. On <date value="1980-05-14">14 May 1980</date>, the women's toilets of the venue sustained damage. <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi> reported that in response to this damage the venue's promoter
<quote><p>addressed patrons on the <hi rend="c">Pa</hi> system concerning the vandalism. Numbers of people present claim the tone of Walsh's [the promoter's] remarks became abusively sexist . . . lesbians who were leaving the venue were told . . . that they would be denied entrance in future unless accompanied by a gay man.<note xml:id="fn258-87" n="45"><p><hi rend="sup">45</hi>For this episode, see Gary Jaynes and Warren Talbot, 'Anger at Ashley's: Sexist Outburst Brings Sharp Response', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 2<hi rend="i"></hi>, no. 5, <date value="1980-06">June 1980</date>, pp. 4-5.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>That Saturday (<date value="1980-05-17">17 May 1980</date>), Young Gays voted to commence a boycott. Over one hundred people picketed Ashley's on 21 May, reducing patronage from 400 to 60, with the demonstrators demanding that management revoke the discriminatory policy and sack the promoter. Protestors chanted 'Gay rights, not right-wing gays!' and <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi> highlighted the promoter's favourite slogan : 'I'm proud to be a rightwing gay'. While management stepped back from the proposed discriminatory door policy, they refused to sack the promoter so Young Gays vowed to maintain the boycott.

The following Wednesday night (<date value="1980-05-28">28 May 1980</date>) Calder recalls that demonstrators were greeted by a 'group of men' who 'pushed and threatened' them, tore their placards and leaflets from their hands and chased them down the street. Police 'just turned their backs'.<note xml:id="fn259-87" n="46"><p><hi rend="sup">46</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, p. 17.</p></note> Despite the breaking of the picket, attendance never picked up and Ashley's closed for a short period.<note xml:id="fn260-87" n="47"><p><hi rend="sup">47</hi>Ibid.</p></note></p>
<p>Calder describes how there was significant division within Young Gays group generated by the boycott: 'this division seemed to fall down previously undefined factional lines'.<note xml:id="fn261-87" n="48"><p><hi rend="sup">48</hi>Ibid, p. 18.</p></note> The boycott helped solidify a politics/social support split in the group, as reflected in the words of a leaflet produced by some members of Young Gays critical of the boycott:
<quote><p><hi rend="c">Please read this Leaflet</hi> . . . All participants in the demonstration are asked to read this leaflet. The signatories are participants in Young Gays. We call ourselves by different lables [sic]: socialist, radical, reformist, and unaligned. We consider ourselves as activists in the Gay Community. A Young Gays meeting, without opposition, endorsed the leaflet calling for this demonstration. The meeting did this on the basis of <hi rend="c">Second Hand Information</hi>. The facts of last Wednesday night are still unclear . . . The signatories are in disagreement on the question of whether this demonstration is needed. However, we agree that:
<list>
<label>1.</label><item>Young Gays should not be involved in the organization of the demonstration. Its primary work should be as a social and <hi rend="c">Support</hi> group.</item>

Capitalization as in the original.</p></note></item>
</list></p></quote></p>
<p>Advocates of the social support role for Young Gays sought to formalize a split from direct political action by calling on members involved in such actions to do so under a different name &#x2013; Radical Gay Youth &#x2013; although Calder suggests such a group never really got off the ground.<note xml:id="fn263-87" n="50"><p><hi rend="sup">50</hi>Ibid.</p></note> No compromise was reached between the different camps and as a result attendance at the weekly Saturday meetings began to drop.<note xml:id="fn264-87" n="51"><p><hi rend="sup">51</hi>Ibid.</p></note></p>
<p>While a consequence of the Ashley's Boycott was a more explicit factionalisation of Young Gays into 'political' members and 'social support' members, it also brought into relief the troubled gender politics of the group. As Calder recounts, Young Gays had 'proportionally fewer women than men in it' ('women comprised approximately 10-20% of the group'), although many of the women who were involved were influential in the group.<note xml:id="fn265-87" n="52"><p><hi rend="sup">52</hi>Ibid, p. 20.</p></note></p>
<p>While Calder proffers a number of reasons for women's low participation &#x2013; men come out earlier and women have other options for community participation through the Women's Movement &#x2013; he does concede, however, that women left because of sexist attitudes and practices.<note xml:id="fn266-87" n="53"><p><hi rend="sup">53</hi>Ibid.</p></note> In this context, explains Calder, the Ashley's Boycott was important for Young Gays in order to try and counter negative perceptions of the group within lesbian communities. The fact, then, that the boycott brought on a split in the group represented not only a failure to reconcile broad views about whether or not the group should have a political or a social support role, but it also demonstrated the
<pb xml:id="n69" n="69"/>
difficulties experienced by the group in trying to create a coalitionist endeavour which paid serious attention to questions of gender and power.</p>
<p>To counter the drop in numbers and energy that accompanied the fallout from the Ashley's Boycott, the group decided to embark upon a 'Fun Revolution'. This involved devoting a Saturday meeting, replete with 'streamers and party hats' to planning the 'aims of the fun revolution'. This led to social activities being planned for most Saturdays for the remainder of <date value="1980">1980</date>. These included parties, a visit to the Pompeii Exhibition at the</p>
<p>National Gallery of Victoria, a softball afternoon at Royal Park, a canoeing day at Studley Park, a Pinball Parlour day, bowling, candle-making, a trip to Ebony Quill coffee shop, a trip to Luna Park, and a trip to Como House.<note xml:id="fn267-87" n="54"><p><hi rend="sup">54</hi>Ibid, p. 22.</p></note> Sessions with invited speakers were organised (e.g. 'alcohol and its effects, and its relationship with the gay community', 'gays and the law,' 'sado-masochism' and 'sexism and lesbian separatism') and the group tried to support the establishment of smaller Young Gay Support Groups to let people relax more in smaller group settings, although, while a couple started, they 'didn't proceed a great deal'. The group also started producing its own newsletter &#x2013; the <hi rend="i">Lavender Sheet &#x2013;</hi> in an effort to improve communication with prospective and disengaging members.<note xml:id="fn268-87" n="55"><p><hi rend="sup">55</hi>Ibid.</p></note></p>
<p>By <date value="1980-09">September 1980</date>, the group had reached a crisis and some members called for a 'new structure' for the group to counter the 'ever decreasing number of people prepared to take responsibility'. The group moved to a more formal committee structure with members holding portfolio responsibilities for publicity, Fun Revolution activities, the <hi rend="i">Lavender Sheet</hi>, discussion groups/monthly discussions, fundraising and Sunday outings. The new structure suggested two-month terms with people getting a one-month break, but too few people were interested in joining the committee.<note xml:id="fn269-87" n="56"><p><hi rend="sup">56</hi>Ibid, pp. 23, 26.</p></note> Just over a year after the group started to meet, Young Gays held its First Birthday Party in Fitzroy's St Mark's Hall (<date value="1980-10-04">4 October 1980</date>). Attracting around 200 people, the day included workshops on topics such as 'Coming Out' and 'Gays Coping with Parents Coping with Gays'; film screenings, including 'Witches and Faggots, Dykes and Poofters'; and a range of other free activities such as volleyball and table-tennis. An evening dance followed, held at Trophy Hall, Melbourne University.<note xml:id="fn270-87" n="57"><p><hi rend="sup">57</hi>Ibid, p. 24. See also 'Young Gays Birthday', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 2, no. 7, August <date value="1980">1980</date>, p. 13; also see 'And Now We Are One', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 2, no. 9, <date value="1980-11">November 1980</date>, p. 13.</p></note></p>
<p>In <date value="1981-02">February 1981</date>, only a few months after these celebrations, <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi> declared Young Gays 'dead'.<note xml:id="fn271-87" n="58"><p><hi rend="sup">58</hi>Paul Miller, 'Young Gays Dissolves', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 3, no. 1, <date value="1981-02">February 1981</date>, p. 19.</p></note> The key reasons put forward for the group's dissolution recall the issues encapsulated by the boycott of Ashley's. Broadly, members decided to disband the group 'since it no longer seemed to be fulfilling its original objectives . . . to be a social-support group'.<note xml:id="fn272-87" n="59"><p><hi rend="sup">59</hi>Ibid.</p></note> In particular,
<quote><p>Some members felt that the group's failure to attract and sustain the presence of women at meetings was sufficient cause for the group to disband. It was also reported that the telephone services, especially the Women's Switchboard and Gayline, were reluctant to refer their young callers to Young Gays . . . Another widely-held view was that Young Gays was seen as too political by the wider gay community. This was attributed to the picket of Ashleys . . . Interestingly, this same promoter has been heard to claim responsibility for the demise of Young Gays.<note xml:id="fn273-87" n="60"><p><hi rend="sup">60</hi>Ibid.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<pb xml:id="n70" n="70"/>
<p>Finishing his account, Calder provides a brief reflection on the 'The Failure of Structurelessness'. From its inception, Young Gays had deliberately eschewed any explicit organizational structure. This was partly due to negative experiences members had had of the bureaucratic, procedural and exclusionary approaches encountered at the National Homosexual Conference at which the group was founded. In discussing the structure of meetings, a Young Gays column in <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi> stresses that:
<quote><p>We want to avoid heavies, elitists and cliques and thus prevent the alienation of young gays who have a lack of experience in handling their ideas and own points of view at formal meetings.<note xml:id="fn274-87" n="61"><p><hi rend="sup">61</hi>'Young Gays', <hi rend="i">Gay Community News</hi>, vol. 1, no. 1, <date value="1979-11">November 1979</date>, p. 11.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>To such ends, the group avoided formal processes such as rules, minute-taking and electing a chair.<note xml:id="fn275-87" n="62"><p><hi rend="sup">62</hi><hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Ly</hi></hi>, p. 26.</p></note> These efforts sought to increase participation around an egalitarian model of collective organising although, in practice, 'a few individuals and ideologies' did, indeed, provide 'the leadership for the group'.<note xml:id="fn276-87" n="63"><p><hi rend="sup">63</hi>Ibid.</p></note></p>
<p>A decision to pursue affiliation with the Victorian Association of Youth Clubs in <date value="1980-04">April 1980</date> (in order to access its resources) generated the first discussions about introducing structure. Affiliation required each group to 'comply to certain structural guidelines'. The group had intended to 'present the "necessary fa&#x00B8;ade"', however 'when the affiliation plans failed to proceed beyond the paper stage, discussions about structure were once again shelved'.<note xml:id="fn277-87" n="64"><p><hi rend="sup">64</hi>Ibid.</p></note> The question of structure was pursued most vigorously in <date value="1980-09">September 1980</date> with efforts to introduce a rotating portfolio system, although this failed to attract new people to take on responsibilities.</p>
<p>For Calder, the dissolution of the group posed important questions for future gay and lesbian groups about the need for some type of formal structure. Structure, he argues, is important in order to avoid alienating members by having meetings which routinely get bogged down in long, repetitive discussions about minor operational tasks and responsibilities.</p>
<p>In Calder's discussion about the low participation of women in the group, he provides examples of a number of strategies that could have been undertaken in order to improve the situation, such as advertising more through women's media and venues, establishing a lesbian caucus, and better targeting activities and discussions to address young lesbians interests.<note xml:id="fn278-87" n="65"><p><hi rend="sup">65</hi>Ibid, p. 20.</p></note> Presumably, had the group had more of the structure which Calder points towards in <date value="1985">1985</date>, it may have had an increased capacity to develop and implement these strategies, suggesting that a turn towards a more structured approach might generate benefits not only in terms of group longevity, but also in terms of enhancing the capacity of the group to operate in longer-term, strategic ways.<note xml:id="fn279-87" n="66"><p><hi rend="sup">66</hi>Ibid, p. 26.</p></note></p>
<p>Apart from the lack of structure, other key reasons identified by Calder to explain the group's demise include the failure to resolve disputes over the group's rationale following the Ashley's Boycott; the fact that perhaps being in the group for 6-12 months 'was long enough to meet most people's needs'; and the lack of support the group received:
<pb xml:id="n71" n="71"/>
<quote><p>Young Gays effectively received no support from anywhere. Certainly they were a proudly independent group, yet had support been offered, it most likely would have been accepted. Where such support was needed was in finding a permanent venue and in the basic administration of running and advertising itself. Without this being organised meant that the group was constantly responding to problems.<note xml:id="fn280-87" n="67"><p><hi rend="sup">67</hi>Ibid, p. 27.</p></note></p></quote></p>

<head>Conclusion</head>
<p>In <date value="1985">1985</date>, Bill Calder wrote <hi rend="i">Lavender Youth</hi> to tell the story of Young Gays, because, in his words, gay and lesbian youth groups 'seem to appear almost annually and any accumulated knowledge of the preceeding [sic] one is largely lost'.<note xml:id="fn281-87" n="68"><p><hi rend="sup">68</hi>Ibid, p. 1.</p></note> This loss of collective memory of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> youth groups remains a strong feature of the field. This is due to many factors which have been in play since the inception of Young Gays and persist, with some important differences, today. They include: the heavy casualisation and high staff turnover in the youth sector; the high turnover of young people's involvement in groups; and the public heath focus of the majority of political and financial support that issues of youth and sexuality attract.</p>
<p>Today, the sheer increase in the volume of public activity around queer youth issues is working to create a space for questions about history to be asked and the availability of new information and social media technologies provides young people, educators and youth workers with tools for the production and dissemination of group histories.<note xml:id="fn282-87" n="69"><p><hi rend="sup">69</hi>For example, see <ptr target="http://www.wayout.org.au/WayOut/wayout-history.html"/>.</p></note> Significantly, the emergence since the <date value="1970">1970s</date> of dedicated (non-medical) researchers working in both funded (e.g. tenured) and community capacities in the broad interdisciplinary field of Australian sexualities studies, as well as the establishment of premiere collections such as that held by the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, means that there are now more resources than ever before available for investigating the important questions that emanate from a history of queer youth and education in Australia.</p>
<p>Some work, in different disciplinary contexts, has sought to work against the loss of memory which Calder refers to,<note xml:id="fn283-87" n="70"><p><hi rend="sup">70</hi>For example, see Daniel Marshall, 'Working with Same Sex Attracted and Transgender Young People: a consultation with workers across Victoria', Melbourne: Social Policy Branch, Department of Human Services, <date value="2005">2005</date>.</p></note> still broadly relevant 25 years on, although a more detailed wider historical reflection is called for. Calder's account raises a series of important, key questions that point towards fundamental concerns of a history of youth, queer sexualities and education in Australia. Departing from his observations about the group's lack of structure and his implicit critique of <date value="1970">1970s</date> collectivist approaches to political organizing on the left, a key concern for this history must be an examination of the different conceptions of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> youth groups, how they have changed over time and what the effects of these changes have been.</p>
<p>Since the late <date value="1990">1990s</date>, Victoria has seen a massive increase in the number of same sex attracted youth groups, supported largely by <hi rend="c">Sti</hi>-awareness<hi rend="sup">72</hi> and <hi rend="c">Hiv</hi>-prevention funding and routinely administered through community health and youth services. To be sure, in a general sense, queer youth groups today have a version of the structure that Calder calls for, although this structure is still rendered weak by the fragile funding
<pb xml:id="n72" n="72"/>
environment for these groups. The history that this article gestures towards offers an opportunity to reflect on the achievement of this level of structure from the historical perspective of forerunners like Young Gays, and to question the costs and the benefits of such structure. Indeed, in the context of the critique of health approaches advanced by scholars working in queer and sexualities studies in education, such a historical analysis would bring a rich dimension to current debates on deficit and the disciplining effects of the privileged role provided to health in the expansion of queer youth services over the past 15 or so years.</p>
<p>Similarly, Calder dedicated the proceeds for his booklet to the National Network of Young Lesbians and Gay Men, but the middle of the <date value="1980">1980s</date> and the first years of the <hi rend="c">Grid/Aids</hi><hi rend="sup">73</hi> pandemic must have provided a starkly different context for organizing around issues of youth and homosexual sex. By examining the different relationships between different generations of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> youth formations, we can bring into relief some of these differences over the past forty years</p>
<p>This historical work also seeks to enrich the field of youth policy studies more generally by contributing to the collective memory around young people, policy and programmatic interventions. In a contemporary policy context where youth participation approaches and the promotion of youth-directed community work are key goals under government funding guidelines,<note xml:id="fn284-87" n="71"><p><hi rend="sup">71</hi>For example, see Youth Participation and Access, Department of Planning and Community Development, <date value="2010">2010</date>, 'Youth Participation and Access', <ptr target="http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/youth/youthparticipation-and-access"/> (accessed <date value="2010-11-19">19 November 2010</date>).</p></note> reflecting on the way in which young people were innovating these techniques themselves with no government or service support over thirty years ago, makes an important contribution to the history of youth in Australia.</p>
<p>While a history of youth, queer sexualities and education would highlight differences over time in group formations and the various effects of these differences, such a history would also necessarily historicise and contextualise understandings of education. The informal teaching and learning work happening among members of Young Gays <hi rend="i">&#x2013;</hi> from their implicitly educational work of facilitating their own collective discussions around their experiences of sexualities in society to their explicit educational work of developing and providing resources to schools &#x2013; demonstrates the way in which the experiences of these young people depart from straightforward interpretations of education which largely consider it to be a synonym for schooling and school-based learning. In this way, histories of groups like Young Gays provide an insight into the innovative development of queer peer-to-peer pedagogical practices at a time when the public discourse on schools and gay and lesbian rights was beginning to flourish. As the case of Young Gays makes clear, the activist collective comes into focus as an exemplary learning space, not only in the sense that those young people who participated in the group learned things through their involvement in it, but also in the contemporary context where the Young Gays episode speaks in instructive ways to contemporary developments in the fields of queer youth services and education.</p>
<p>Importantly, the history of youth, queer sexualities and education in Australia must be told not only so that we can learn from the past and so that the past may illuminate the future, but also because the act of memorialisation brings into relief those
<pb xml:id="n73" n="73"/>
figures struggling at the margins of history whose contributions can often be left out of history's major narratives. In his account of the split in Young Gays following the Ashley's Boycott, Calder refers to a caucus of the main group constituting the more political members of Young Gays &#x2013; Radical Gay Youth &#x2013; which never really got off the ground. In the archive file for Young Gays is a piece of Radical Gay Youth correspondence, featuring the signatures of about a dozen young activists. Among the signatures are the names of Alison Thorne, Tim Conigrave and John Caleo. Within a few years, Thorne, by then a teacher, would be engulfed by a media firestorm over her comments about children and sex; and Conigrave and Caleo would go on to be diagnosed with <hi rend="c">Hiv</hi>.</p>
<p>Through these figures, Young Gays appears almost like a brief moment of political promise, with the first generation of post-Gay Liberation youth already organizing themselves to change their world at the dawn of a decade in which everything would change so rapidly. Quickly relationships between youth, queer sexualities and education would again become overdetermined by conflations of homosexuality with paedophilia and disease. As a kind of <hi rend="i">Back to the Future</hi> moment, there is little doubt that the reinforcement of these conflations that occurred throughout the <date value="1980">1980s</date> in Australia exercise an ongoing influence on contemporary discourses of youth, queer sexualities and education. And this is why a historical turn in regard to these matters will enrich contemporary debates.</p>

<p>Little is known of Caroline's early life until in <date value="1833">1833</date>, at the age of 21, she sailed alone from England to Van Diemen's Land. In <date value="1836-04">April 1836</date> she travelled to Port Phillip with John Batman's family, as temporary governess to the Batmans' daughters. In <date value="1837">1837</date> she moved to Geelong to live with the Thomsons, with whom she'd become friends in Tasmania, and became governess to their daughter.</p>
<p>When her house was completed, Anne invited Caroline to join her as a partner in the new squatting venture. Caroline accepted and they took up residence at Boronggoop in <date value="1841-08">August 1841</date>. For the next decade, trading as Drysdale &amp; Newcomb, the two women engaged in a successful pastoral and farming business. In the mid-<date value="1840">1840s</date> they acquired the freehold of 'Coriyule', a property on the Bellarine Peninsula, and built a large house to which they moved in <date value="1849">1849</date>.

<p>The above summary shows that Anne Drysdale and Caroline Newcomb were very interesting and unconventional women. Anne spent her last thirteen years in Australia, where she was chiefly notable as a unique 'gentlewoman farmer'. Caroline lived in this country for more than half of her life and was notable in several ways, from being one of the first women to arrive at the settlement of Melbourne to her later work as an activist in local religious, social and political affairs in the Geelong region. But their individuality has been eclipsed by the label 'the lady squatters' that has adhered to them over time. They are now an historical couple, defined by the thirteen years they lived and worked together rather than by their separate achievements or other periods of their lives.</p>

It seems that an unintended ambiguity has been read into this comment in the four decades since it was published. The 'exceptional interest' has been seen less in the activities of the women as squatters, and more in their partnership, with that term given a modern meaning as a committed relationship outside traditional marriage.</p>
<p>Anne and Caroline did form a partnership (Drysdale &amp; Newcomb) through which they ran their pastoral and farming business. And since they lived together as well as worked together, they were also partners in setting up and maintaining a household and a shared way of life. Whilst in <date value="2011">2011</date> this would certainly place them within Centrelink's definition of a same-sex couple, there would not have been such meaning given to partnership in a mid-19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century context.</p>

<p>The florid language gives the partnership a romantic air, but the fact that the writer was a well-known Presbyterian clergyman makes it highly unlikely that he was describing an intimate relationship.

<head>The queer teapot</head>
<p>In <date value="2005">2005</date>-<date value="2006">6</date> a pilot project was undertaken by Museum Victoria, in conjunction with the State Library of Victoria and the Australian Gay and Lesbian Archives, to survey the collections of museums and other institutions to identify material relevant to the histories of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender (<hi rend="c">Glbt</hi>) communities. The project was inevitably fraught with conceptual and methodological problems, particularly in identifying and defining the sexuality of people long dead.</p>
<p>These problems are exemplified in the case of two items identified in the survey as 'relevant' to <hi rend="c">Glbt</hi> history. The first, from the State Library of Victoria collection, is the diary of Anne Drysdale, described in the survey report as 'female squatter near Geelong, who lived with female partner for thirteen years'. The second, related to that 'female partner', is a silver teapot in the Museum Victoria collection. This might seem an unlikely inclusion but it is in fact a trophy, and bears the engraved inscription: Geelong &amp; Western District| Agricultural &amp; Horticultural Society <date value="1856">1856</date> &amp; <date value="1857">7</date>| Prizes to | Miss Newcomb| <hi rend="i">for | Potatoes, Cauliflowers, Asparagus &amp; for Turkeys etc.'</hi>.</p>
<p>As the author of the survey report explained, it was 'a very interesting object, which did not meet what we might call a typical kind of object that could tell a story about queer sexualities in Australian history'. Nevertheless she went on to offer her interpretation of the interesting object:
<quote><p>This was a teapot that belonged to Caroline Newcombe [sic], lifelong partner of Anne Drysdale &#x2013; the 'lady squatters' and entrepreneurs who established a farming
<pb xml:id="n77" n="77"/>
homestead on the Bellarine peninsula near Geelong. While the object itself does not seem to 'tell a queer story', it gives us an opportunity to tell a story about life in the western district around that time that incorporates a focus on social attitudes to sexuality, the development of personal identity including sexual expression, ideas of partnerships, gender and love. It allows the voices of these women to be heard in another way.<note xml:id="fn292-87" n="8"><p><hi rend="sup">8</hi>Kate Davison, <hi rend="i">Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Material Survey Report</hi>, Melbourne: Museum Victoria, <date value="2006">2006</date>. The survey is discussed in Kate Davison's article in this issue.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>The expectation that such a story could be told is unrealistic, to say the least, and not simply because of the dearth of documentary records about social life in the Geelong region in the <date value="1840">1840s</date>. In the surviving records of the lives of Anne and Caroline there is nothing that gives any indication of 'social attitudes to sexuality, the development of personal identity [and] sexual expression'. This is not surprising given the rarity of historical evidence about sexual behaviour &#x2013; especially in the case of middle-aged, middle-class spinsters. So, in the absence of any evidence, there can only be speculation about the sexuality of Miss Drysdale and Miss Newcomb, and this would be futile as well as pointless. (In response to an enquiry to Museum Victoria about the justification for the <hi rend="c">Glbt</hi> tag on the Newcomb teapot, an unnamed curator declared: 'As there is no evidence . . . that they did <hi rend="i">not</hi> have a sexual relationship [unless the enquirer has found some herself that she can supply us with] to the contrary, I think there is no reason to remove the <hi rend="c">Glbt</hi> reference'.)</p>
<p>The existing records do, however, make it possible to know something of the women, their shared way of life and their friendship, and allow their voices to be heard 'in another way': speaking as women rather than 'lady squatters'. Miss Newcomb's teapot might not tell a queer story, but it does tell a rare story of female friendship.</p>

<head>'Linked in the closest affection'</head>
<p>There are only two key sources of information about the women's lives in Australia, and these are supplemented by some fragmentary records &#x2013; a few letters, contemporary diaries and journals, and newspapers. The most important source is the diary that Anne kept from her departure from Scotland until shortly before her death, and which Caroline maintained for a further year. Four of its five volumes have survived. Although it covers well over a decade (from <date value="1839">1839</date> to <date value="1854">1854</date>), Anne's diary tells us surprisingly little about her. It began as a personal, shipboard journal, though she did not confide in it her thoughts and feelings, reflecting on the old life, anticipating the new. After the women moved to Boronggoop, the diary gradually became a relatively impersonal record of day to day working life, interspersed with accounts of domestic and social life. Written in the plural, it's a record of Caroline's life as well as Anne's &#x2013; and in fact Caroline's activities probably take up more space.</p>
<p>One of the surprising absences from the diary is a record of the year Anne spent at Kardinia with the Thomsons and Caroline; there is no mention of Caroline until they arrived at Boronggoop. The mere handful of entries over this time may not mean Anne had nothing to say about her new life and friends, but rather that she was not an
<pb xml:id="n78" n="78"/>
inveterate diarist &#x2013; and was naturally reticent. That could also explain the almost total absence of the personal throughout the whole diary: it was kept chiefly as the record of work and activity, not private matters.</p>
<p>The second, though less substantial, source is the extended obituary of Caroline that appeared in three parts in the <hi rend="i">Wesleyan Chronicle</hi> in <date value="1875">1875</date>. This was published anonymously but internal evidence indicates that it was undoubtedly written by her husband, Rev. James Dodgson. His account is derived from Caroline's diary as well as from his life with her during the twelve years of their marriage. The relatively few extracts he selected from the diary show the depth of her religious convictions and her constant quest for spiritual perfection, but reveal little about other aspects of her life. Since Caroline's diaries, like the fourth volume of Anne's, have disappeared over time, there is no way of knowing what record of life at Boronggoop and Coriyule they may have contained.</p>
<p>The problems presented by the limitations of sources are evident when apparently simple questions are asked, such as the women's reasons for coming to Australia: a vital element of their stories. The only recorded evidence is based on hearsay, and is unconvincing to say the least.</p>
<p>Each woman made the momentous decision to emigrate at a different stage of her life: Anne was in her late forties &#x2013; a most unusual age for a single female emigrant. Caroline left England when she was 21, not unusual at a time when hundreds of young unmarried women were sailing to the colonies. The decision to seek a new life in an unknown country may have been less difficult because neither of the women had a settled home or close family ties. For each there must have been some kind of discontent, if not unhappiness, creating the desire for such radical change.</p>
<p>From the little known about Caroline's early life she had an unusual childhood, having spent some time in Spain where her father was in the English consular service. When he died, she was brought up in England by her grandmother, and it was after her grandmother's death that she emigrated to Van Diemen's Land. Caroline's decision was attributed to her health. Dodgson wrote that she 'had been delicate from childhood' and continued to suffer 'a distressing cough' every winter until 'a gentleman from Van Diemen's Land . . . hearing her cough, recommended to her the genial climate of this southern hemisphere . . . After weighing the matter over, she resolved to embark'.<note xml:id="fn293-87" n="9"><p><hi rend="sup">9</hi><hi rend="i">Wesleyan Chronicle</hi>, <date value="1875-01">Jan. 1875</date>.</p></note> Embarkation on such a journey was surely a drastic remedy for a cough, no matter how distressing.</p>
<p>Caroline came to Australia in the early <date value="1830">1830s</date>, when emigration was being seen as a solution for the dual problems of surplus women at home and a shortage of women in the colonies. Many young women came out hoping or expecting to be married, and most of them eventually were. But Caroline remained unmarried until late in her life, and was either not looking for a husband or did not find the husband she was looking for. Perhaps a clue to her reasons for leaving home might be found in the comment made

<p>It is likely that, as a respectable, educated woman, she earned a living as a governess in Van Diemen's Land. When she came to Port Phillip she may have run a school in Melbourne for several months before moving to Geelong to live with the Thomsons. There, according to Dodgson, she 'remained as guest, making herself useful to the family', notably acting as governess for Jane Thomson. Caroline was in many ways a typical governess, socially and economically marginalised, dependent on others, and with ambivalent status within the family that employed her. The Thomsons might well have been her best friends, and happy to have her living with them. But if that arrangement came to an end, what then? Another governess position? Open a school? Live alone?</p>
<pb xml:id="n80" n="80"/>
<p>Meeting Anne Drysdale brought the first prospect of change for Caroline. The partnership Anne offered would liberate her from restrictions and dependencies, and had the potential for a new and more fulfilling way of life. It would enable her to achieve independence, find stability, and share the making of a home. And it would also bring her the bond of affection and love.</p>
<p>Presumably Caroline had little money, so her financial situation would have been more assured, though there is no way of knowing what arrangements were made between the two women: perhaps, crudely put, Anne provided the capital and Caroline the labour. There is more than a hint of this in a letter from a Victorian squatter to John Drysdale after Anne's death, when Caroline became sole beneficiary of her estate:
<quote><p>while we admit that your sister was under great obligation to Miss N for her activity in the management of the concern; everyone seems to think that the obligations to each other were in some degree mutual; and it would not have excited any wonder had Miss Newcomb been left with a life rent of the property; reverting to your sister's relations after her death.<note xml:id="fn295-87" n="11"><p><hi rend="sup">11</hi>George Russell to John Drysdale, <date value="1854">1854</date>: typescript, P. L. Brown Papers, Geelong Heritage Centre.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>Anne's reasons for emigrating were also unconvincingly attributed to health. The Rev. John Dunmore Lang<note xml:id="fn296-87" n="12"><p><hi rend="sup">12</hi>John Dunmore Lang, (<date value="1799">1799</date>-<date value="1878">1878</date>).

See <ptr target="mailto:http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020069b.htm"/>.</p></note> reported after his first meeting with her at Boronggoop: 'being a martyr, as she told me, to the coughs and colds, and other ills that flesh is heir to in our hyperborean Scottish climate, she resolved to emigrate to a milder region, to indulge in her favourite pursuits'. And he went on to say that since emigrating, 'She has uniformly enjoyed excellent health'.<note xml:id="fn297-87" n="13"><p><hi rend="sup">13</hi>Lang, <hi rend="i">Phillipsland</hi>, p. 6.</p></note> It's possible that indulgence in 'favourite pursuits', specifically farming, may well have been of more influence than coughs and colds in her resolve to emigrate.</p>
<p>Anne was an only daughter with four older brothers, and the death of her mother meant that from an early age she was 'the woman of the house'. It was not a happy family, and after her father's death there were bitter and protracted disputes over his will. Anne spent much time on her brother John's property, then moved from Fife and set up on her own farm in Ayrshire. 'In those years', she recorded in her diary, 'I certainly experienced more of unmixed happiness than any others of my life.' We do not know why or when those happy years came to an end, or why she then decided to go to Australia and 'tho a lone woman . . . do there as she has long done here &#x2013; farm for herself!'<note xml:id="fn298-87" n="14"><p><hi rend="sup">14</hi>Mrs Jane Williams (Edinburgh), <date value="1841">1841</date>, quoted in P. L. Brown, <hi rend="i">Clyde Company Papers</hi>, London, Oxford University Press, <date value="1941">1941</date>-<date value="1971">71</date>, vol. 2, p. 228.</p></note></p>
<p>In Geelong Anne was forced to contemplate the reality of squatting life for 'a lone woman' and must have discovered her need for a companion, a partner in the enterprise. After living for a year with the Thomsons at Kardinia, she and Caroline had become close friends. Despite the twenty-year disparity in age they had much in common, and it must have been almost a foregone conclusion that Anne would invite her friend to join her at Boronggoop.</p>
<p>The age difference may well have defined the friendship, with the older woman &#x2013; more experienced, socially assured, with money and connections &#x2013; being generously supportive of the younger. And there was a more pragmatic aspect of their ages. Caroline was a kindred spirit but she also had qualities and attributes that would help Anne realise
<pb xml:id="n81" n="81"/>
her ambitions as a squatter: energy, strength, practical skills and a longer experience of life in the colonies.</p>
<p>James Dodgson, in his wife's obituary, gave a rather surprising description of the women's relationship: 'though diverse in temperament, they beautifully dovetailed into each other. What one lacked the other supplied; they were linked in the closest affection'.<note xml:id="fn299-87" n="15"><p><hi rend="sup">15</hi><hi rend="i">Wesleyan Chronicle</hi>, <date value="1875-03">March 1875</date>.</p></note> As he had arrived at Coriyule about six years after Anne's death, his somewhat fulsome description was based on what he had learned from Caroline. The women did indeed have differences in temperament, but the 'beautiful dovetailing' is probably a flight of clerical rhetoric.</p>
<p>On the evidence of the extracts from her diary quoted by Dodgson in his obituary, Caroline was quick-tempered, vowing, for example, 'to watch over my temper and heart, and never harbour an angry thought, nor utter an angry word'.<note xml:id="fn300-87" n="16"><p><hi rend="sup">16</hi><hi rend="i">Wesleyan Chronicle</hi>, <date value="1875-01">Jan 1875</date>.</p></note> Her husband knew her as 'high-spirited, strong-willed and impetuous', and with a temperament that was 'the cause of many tears, and much grief of soul . . . she had no small task to perform in keeping her fiery despotism in proper check'.<note xml:id="fn301-87" n="17"><p><hi rend="sup">17</hi>Ibid.</p></note> She also had a restless energy and was extraordinarily active. Anne's diary is an exhaustive &#x2013; and exhausting &#x2013; record of Caroline's busy life: trips on horseback or driving a cart several miles to and from Geelong; work on the property, in the house and in the garden; involvement in her church and on various local committees.</p>
<p>Over time, the disparity in their ages would have made their temperamental, and physical, differences more obvious. As Caroline's activity intensified, Anne (who was described as 'very stout')<note xml:id="fn302-87" n="18"><p><hi rend="sup">18</hi>Janet Richardson, guest at Boronggoop <date value="1848">1848</date>, quoted in Brown, <hi rend="i">Clyde Company Papers</hi>, vol, 5, p. 617.</p></note> became less active. In her earlier years in Scotland she had been intrepid, and a hard-working farm manager. But once the operation of Boronggoop was established, she gradually sat back and left it to the more energetic Caroline to supervise and assist the work of the property. While Anne was the dominant partner in the business because of her experience, capital and canniness, it was Caroline who determined the way they lived. Both women were strong, but Caroline's strength was reinforced by her extreme religiosity &#x2013; and this was the greatest difference between them.</p>
<p>Anne was a Presbyterian, whose forebears included two clergymen, one of whom was Royal Chaplain and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Her diary suggests that her piety was of a conventional kind; her reports of services and sermons were rather perfunctory and she could sometimes be deterred from attending church on the slightest excuse: a minor illness, a predicted change in the weather, or a blister on her foot.</p>
<p>Caroline had been brought up in the Church of England but in Geelong in <date value="1839">1839</date> she became a convert to Methodism. Her conversion to the Wesleyan Methodism of the time might be seen as surprising as it was still a predominantly working class religion, and Caroline was, in her husband's words, 'a person of education and good breeding'. But part of the church's mission was 'to bring together different ranks of society' and in Australia, as in England and America, more people from the middle ranks were becoming Methodists.</p>
<pb xml:id="n82" n="82"/>
<p>It is probable that one of the reasons for Caroline's conversion was that Methodism had more to offer her than other more formal, less personal religions. To a single woman, attached to but not part of a family household, and a restless, driven woman with no outlet for her energies and feelings, there would have been an emotional as well as spiritual appeal. Methodists, in the words of its founder John Wesley, ' . . . unite themselves in order to pray together, to receive the word of exhortation, and to watch over one another in love'.<note xml:id="fn303-87" n="19"><p><hi rend="sup">19</hi>Elizabeth Sophia Fletcher, <hi rend="i">The Methodist Class-Meeting: an essay on Christian fellowship</hi>, London: Elliot Stock, <date value="1878">1878</date>.</p></note> Their church, which called itself a 'society', offered membership in a family rather than an organisation, personalised by intense involvement in group activities like the weekly class meetings that were an essential part of the framework of Methodism.</p>
<p>The church also gave women opportunities to participate in forms of worship; although they were no longer accepted as preachers as they had been in early Methodism, women could hold positions such as leaders of class meetings, acting as lay assistants to the ministers. Caroline fairly quickly became a class leader in Geelong, and the meetings were extremely important to her, 'from her entrance into the Methodist Society to the close of her life. She ever avowed that [they] met a want in her experience which nothing else appeared to supply . . . '.<note xml:id="fn304-87" n="20"><p><hi rend="sup">20</hi><hi rend="i">Wesleyan Chronicle</hi>, <date value="1875-01">Jan. 1875</date>.</p></note> Dodgson's account shows that Caroline liked to vocalise her religion, not just in class meetings but by praying aloud when alone and with others, and reading sermons on Sunday evenings at home. It is easier to see her as a frustrated Methodist preacher than as a preacher's wife!</p>
<p>From the time of her conversion, Caroline believed her life to be ordered by God. When she moved to Boronggoop, for example, she wrote in her diary: 'I left Dr Thomson's house for one I am to call my own. This change in my temporal affairs is, I humbly trust, under the guidance of my heavenly Father . . .'<note xml:id="fn305-87" n="21"><p><hi rend="sup">21</hi>Ibid.</p></note> As Dodgson put it, 'Though entering upon this new sphere, and called upon to discharge new and difficult duties, [Caroline] still kept the <hi rend="i">attainment of holiness</hi> more or less prominently before the mind'. But she found that was not always easy:
<quote><p>Our house is very small, and the partitions slight, so that what is said in one room can be heard in another, which has always prevented me from praying aloud when in private. And I find that, when engaged in mental prayer, my mind is apt to fly off to temporal concerns, which the sound of my voice tends to prevent. <note xml:id="fn306-87" n="22"><p><hi rend="sup">22</hi><hi rend="i">Wesleyan Chronicle</hi>, <date value="1875-03">March 1875</date>.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>Anne was obviously accepting of Caroline's religiosity, perhaps slightly awed and impressed by her friend who presided over family prayers '&amp; prays extempore very beautifully' and who believed she was 'called to a high state of holiness . . . I feel a clear conviction that the Lord has prepared great things for me'.<note xml:id="fn307-87" n="23"><p><hi rend="sup">23</hi><hi rend="i">Wesleyan Chronicle</hi>, <date value="1875-01">Jan. 1875</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>Under Caroline's influence, their home became an active centre of Methodism in Geelong. Boronggoop was included on the preaching circuit and for some time the local minister held a weekly evening service at the house, attended by family, staff and visitors. Church-related meetings were occasionally held there, and visiting clergymen were given hospitality. However, while participating with Caroline in Methodist activities, Anne remained a member of the Presbyterian church, and until they moved to Coriyule, they attended separate churches on most Sundays. 'Their home was . . . a happy Christian
<pb xml:id="n83" n="83"/>
home, where God was ever loved and served' said Dodgson, perhaps reflecting the view of Lang who found the women 'exhibited the goodly and influential example of a highly respectable family, living in the fear of God and in the zealous observance of all the ordinances of religion'. <note xml:id="fn308-87" n="24"><p><hi rend="sup">24</hi>Lang, <hi rend="i">Phillipsland</hi>, p. 6.</p></note></p>
<p>In the Boronggoop years their home was usually filled with people: a constant stream of callers and guests who stayed overnight or longer. The latter included people from the 'home' on the other side of the world: 'The report of their establishment having reached home, many persons on coming out brought letters of introduction from some of the ladies' relations or friends, who found a home there until an opening presented itself '.<note xml:id="fn309-87" n="25"><p><hi rend="sup">25</hi><hi rend="i">Wesleyan Chronicle</hi>, <date value="1875-03">March 1875</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>There were often younger people in the house, either Caroline's pupils or girls 'taken in' for charitable reasons. Two of these were part-Aboriginal sisters brought from King Island to Melbourne for fostering after the death of their father. Some of the daughters of John and Eliza Batman were both short- and long-term residents, and a great responsibility, as Anne wrote to a relative in <date value="1846">1846</date>: 'The two girls Batman who lived with us for four years have gone to live with their mother. This was her own wish &amp; it is a great relief to us, as their education took up a great deal of Miss Newcomb's time &amp; we could not leave home even for a few hours without being anxious about them'.<note xml:id="fn310-87" n="26"><p><hi rend="sup">26</hi>Letter to Mrs Drysdale, quoted in Anne Hoban, 'Anne Drysdale: a sense of place', <hi rend="c">Ba</hi> Hons thesis, La Trobe University, <date value="1987">1987</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>Among the guests frequently mentioned in Anne's diary were three or four single women, who obviously found Boronggoop a congenial place. Two in particular, Miss McLeod and Miss Morris, seem to have also enjoyed the opportunity for vigorous outdoor activity on their visits, riding around the paddocks with Caroline and helping with her work on the property and in the garden. Other single women were occasional visitors, including one of whom Anne wrote rather cryptically, 'We think her an upright tho' an excentric [sic] woman'.</p>

<p>By the mid-19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, social changes were reflected in attitudes that seemed more pragmatic, dismissive of the old concept of romantic friendship and beginning to
<pb xml:id="n84" n="84"/>
perceive impropriety in its excesses. As Dinah Mulock Craik, a popular English writer of moralistic novels, believed:
<quote><p>For two women, past early girlhood, to be completely absorbed in one another, and make public demonstration of the fact, by caresses or quarrels, is so repugnant to commonsense, that where it ceases to be silly it becomes actually wrong. But to see two women, whom Providence has denied nearer ties, by a wise substitution making the best of fate, loving, sustaining and comforting one another, with a tenderness often closer than that of sisters, because it has all the novelty of election which belongs to the conjugal tie itself &#x2013; this, I say, is an honourable and lovely sight.<note xml:id="fn313-87" n="29"><p><hi rend="sup">29</hi>Craik, <hi rend="i">A Woman's Thoughts About Women</hi> (<date value="1858">1858</date>) quoted in Martha Vicinus, <hi rend="i">Independent Women: work and community for single women, <date value="1850">1850</date>-<date value="1920">1920</date></hi>, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, <date value="1985">1985</date>.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>The relationship between Anne Drysdale and Caroline Newcomb was not by any definition a romantic friendship: the prudent Scot and the fervent Methodist were the antithesis of passionate, sentimental friends such as the ladies of Llangollen. This is evident just in a comparison of diaries. Anne's, with its formal references to 'Miss N' and later 'Caroline,' is in stark contrast with Eleanor Butler's, who describes Sarah as 'my better half', 'my beloved', 'my sweet love' and other terms of endearment. Caroline was also formal, referring to 'Miss D' and 'Miss Drysdale', though in her personal diary there are two or three mentions of 'my dear Anne'. After Anne's death, there were references such as 'my beloved Anne', but these are embedded within the strangely passionate language of Methodism.</p>
<p>If not romantic, their friendship might best be described as companionate. There is a sense of Caroline's idea of companionate female friendship in this rather curious &#x2013; and curiously extended &#x2013; report by Dodgson (which also provides an excellent example of the pitfalls of reading 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century words with 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> century eyes):
<quote><p>As time wore on, and new and trying circumstances presented themselves, [Caroline] felt more keenly the great loss she had sustained in the death of Miss Drysdale . . . The void thus created inspired the desire to have some one of the same sex with her again to whom she could become attached, and with whom she could, as heretofore, hold unreserved intercourse. This feeling, however, was scanned with a jealous eye. 'I have been greatly harassed for the last two or three weeks for an earthly friend such as my beloved Anne was, and a predilection for one took possession of my heart. I discouraged the feeling, lest it should be a desire of Satan to draw my heart from my adorable Saviour'. The desire, however, for a time gained ground, and in hope of deciding the question, she invited lady friends to pay her a lengthened visit without informing them of her object. This course, however, was unsuccessful . . . .<note xml:id="fn314-87" n="30"><p><hi rend="sup">30</hi><hi rend="i">Wesleyan Chronicle</hi>, <date value="1875-03">March 1875</date>.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>This strange but sad anecdote gives a clear expression of the kind of loneliness and deep need for 'attachment' that first brought Anne and Caroline together at Boronggoop.</p>

<p>Miss Newcomb's teapot has prompted the telling of a story of two close friends who made what Mrs Craik termed a 'wise substitution making the best of fate'. They were single women 'denied nearer ties', combining and sharing their assets and talents to
<pb xml:id="n85" n="85"/>
make a home for themselves, creating a family household. Their circumstances were very different from those of other spinsters in Geelong who would have lived with parents or family members &#x2013; and perhaps still held out hopes of marriage.</p>
<p>Anne seems to have had no inclination to marry and was probably regarded as beyond marriageable age when she arrived in Port Phillip. Caroline married several years after Anne's death, and then only at God's direction: as she said, 'I have not taken this step to please anybody, not even my friends, but to please God.'<note xml:id="fn315-87" n="31"><p><hi rend="sup">31</hi><hi rend="i">Wesleyan Chronicle</hi>, <date value="1875-04">April 1875</date>.</p></note> They were both women who saw themselves as independent of men, and equal if not superior to them. Caroline is said to have declared 'Tell me what a man can do that I cannot!' while Anne declared in a letter to her brother that Caroline 'has a head equal to 10 men at least'.</p>
<p>In colonial Victoria where men greatly outnumbered women, two apparently determined spinsters setting up house together might have been cause for comment at a time when, as one historian has suggested, 'single women were labelled "deviant" not because of their friendships, but because of their refusal to marry . . . women's friendships were a threat simply because they were an alternative to marriage'.<note xml:id="fn316-87" n="32"><p><hi rend="sup">32</hi>Vicinus, <hi rend="i">Independent Women</hi>, p<hi rend="i">. 36</hi>.</p></note></p>
<p>Regardless of whether the friendship of Anne and Caroline was perceived as a threat, it was obviously the subject of discussion and rumour among their contemporaries. According to the writer of a memoir of life on the Bellarine Peninsula: 'It is said that, on becoming partners, the ladies made a pact not to marry'.<note xml:id="fn317-87" n="33"><p><hi rend="sup">33</hi>Eunice McLeod, 'Life on the Bellarine Peninsula', typescript, <date value="1962">1962</date>. Geelong Heritage Centre.</p></note> But the more commonly-held view was expressed in this succinct telling of the women's story in a Geelong newspaper's account of Caroline's funeral in <date value="1871">1871</date>:
<quote><p>on Miss Drysdale taking up her residence on the coast near the township that now bears her name, Mrs. Dodgson then Miss Newcombe [sic] went to reside with her as lady's companion. A firm and lasting friendship became established, and the two ladies lived like sisters till the death of Miss Drysdale, when the management of the property was undertaken by Miss Newcombe.<note xml:id="fn318-87" n="34"><p><hi rend="sup">34</hi><hi rend="i">Geelong Advertiser</hi>, <date value="1874-10-08">8 Oct. 1874</date>.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>The innocuous-sounding 'living like sisters' is an interesting term. In the first half of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century it was a euphemistic way of referring to female couples, but in 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century Geelong it was probably the only term that people could find to describe the friendship of 'the two ladies'. And it was a term that had connotations of a closeness not found in other descriptions of them such as 'two excellent maiden ladies'.</p>
<p>There was undeniably a strong bond between Anne Drysdale and Caroline Newcomb, and their partnership was predominantly a close, thirteen-year friendship rather than simply a business arrangement. But those who may want to categorise their relationship will ultimately find it impossible to place it on the continuum 'At one end of [which] lies committed heterosexuality, at the other uncompromising homosexuality; between, a wide latitude of emotions and sexual feelings.'<note xml:id="fn319-87" n="35"><p><hi rend="sup">35</hi>Smith-Rosenberg, 'The female world', p. 29.</p></note></p>
<p>On the basis of the little evidence available, the most apposite characterisation of the relationship is in the words of Mrs Craik: 'loving, sustaining and comforting one another, with a tenderness often closer than that of sisters'.</p>

<div xml:id="t1-g-t8-body-d1">
<p><hi rend="c">Rennie Ellis</hi> was a renowned Melbourne photographer and his collection is a major document of Australian social history covering the last decades of the 20th century. Comprising over half a million original negatives and transparencies, it is unique in providing a view of the post-war generation from a photographer immersed in the culture he was recording.</p>
<p>Rennie studied at Melbourne University before dropping out to work in advertising. He bought his first camera to document a round-the-world trip, and began working as a freelance photojournalist in the <date value="1970">1970s</date>. He photographed all aspects of Australian life, recording the hedonistic society of his times in a deeply humanist way. He died suddenly in <date value="2003">2003</date>.</p>
<p>In <date value="2009">2009</date> the Directors of the Rennie Ellis Photographic Archive, Kerry Oldfield Ellis and Manuela Furci, approached the State Library with a proposal that a significant component of the Archive be acquired by the Library. They were honouring Rennie's wishes that his collection be held at the State Library of Victoria and accessible to the people of Victoria.</p>
<p>The Library is in the process of purchasing the collection. Last year a successful fundraising campaign by the State Library of Victoria Foundation raised over $50,000 to assist with its acquisition. Purchase of the collection has also received assistance from the Australian Government through the National Cultural Heritage Account.</p>
<p>Rennie's collection provides a unique visual record of the dynamic cultures and sub-cultures of Melbourne, spanning four decades from the late <date value="1960">1960s</date> and reflecting the photographer's passion for his hometown. The collection records Melbourne's diverse street life, evocative images of Toorak Road and graffiti sites. There are images documenting the city's twin sporting obsessions: <hi rend="c">Afl</hi> and the Melbourne Cup as well as events such as Anzac Day and local street festivals. There are photographs of well known Melbourne identities, such as racehorse trainer Bart Cummings and socialite Lillian Frank, as well as portraits of ordinary people, from suburban families to the Senior Citizens Club of the Fitzroy Council in the <date value="1970">1970s</date>. Melbourne's rise as a fashion capital is also captured, with images of mainstream and alternative fashion, on the catwalk and behind the scenes, and other images record the nightclub scene of the <date value="1970">1970s</date> and '<date value="1980">80s</date>.</p>
<p>The collection is being transferred to the State Library in stages with images of the Melbourne Cup, <hi rend="c">Afl</hi>, fashion and personalities already received. Digitised images are being made available on the State Library's website.</p>

<p>Gay Pride Week was held in Melbourne in <date value="1973-09">September 1973</date>. The gay liberation movement had exploded onto the scene in Australia in <date value="1970">1970</date>, but by <date value="1973">1973</date> many activists were gripped by a sense that the best days were behind them. Gay Pride Week was organised at the suggestion of Sydney Gay Liberation, as a way of shaking off this mood. Liberationists in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide took up the proposal enthusiastically. The intention was to draw upon the full repertoire of activism &#x2013; celebratory demonstrations, militant zaps, educational activities, coming out, flaunting it. Targeted were:
<quote><p>all the institutions of our oppression: the police courts, job discrimination, the bigoted churchmen and politicians, the media, the psychiatrists, the aversion
<pb xml:id="n88" n="88"/>
therapists, the military, the schools, the universities, the work-places ... It will also seek to change the mind of the prejudiced, the fearful, the conditioned, the sexually repressed, all those who in oppressing us, oppress themselves.<note xml:id="fn320-87" n="1"><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi>'Gay Pride Week', <hi rend="i">Melbourne Gay Liberation Newsletter</hi>.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>It was also intended that it:
<quote><p>will say to gay and straight alike: gay is good, gay is proud, gay is aggressively fighting for liberation. It will say to gays: come out and stand up. Only you can win your own liberation. Come out of the ghettos, the bars and beats, from your closets in suburbia and in your own minds and join the struggle for your own liberation.<note xml:id="fn321-87" n="2"><p><hi rend="sup">2</hi>Ibid.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>Melbourne organised graffiti paint-ups,<note xml:id="fn322-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi>Two of these survived into the <date value="1990">1990s</date> before disappearing.

[<date value="1973-09">September 1973</date>].</p></note></p>
<p>The centrepiece of the week was a picnic in the Botanical Gardens, attended by a hundred and fifty lesbians and gay men. Rennie Ellis reported in the <hi rend="i">Nation Review</hi> that the public response to the picnic was one of 'good humour at least and an easy going acceptance at best'.<note xml:id="fn324-87" n="5"><p><hi rend="sup">5</hi>Rennie Ellis, 'A Gay Picnic in the Park', <hi rend="i">Nation Review</hi>, 14-20 <date value="1973-09">September 1973</date>, p. <date review="1516">1516</date>.</p></note> The 'infectious charm' of the picnickers, their very gay songs, hand-in-hand promenading, games of Drop the Hanky and Spin the Bottle amused the passers-by. Until a policeman appeared and announced that games were not permitted in the park. Faced with the obvious riposte &#x2013; that children all over were playing games &#x2013; he announced that he would decide what was a game and what was not. ('I'm game if you're game' a voice from somewhere in the crowd murmured). Feisty Radicalesbians continued to argue, threats of arrest were uttered ('I'm not playing around anymore' he declared, straight-faced) and the crowd duly settled down to polish off their turkey.<note xml:id="fn325-87" n="6"><p><hi rend="sup">6</hi>'<hi rend="c">Mglf</hi>' [sic], <hi rend="i">Gay Rays</hi>, <date value="1973-12">December 1972</date>.</p></note> One spectator was heard to remark that he had no idea that there were so many homosexuals in Melbourne. And which was after all, the point of the week's events.</p>
<p>But the moment that most people remember, even decades later, was the arrival of Gordon Doak at the demo in the City Square.<note xml:id="fn326-87" n="7"><p><hi rend="sup">7</hi>'Come on Victoria, your time is up', <hi rend="i">Stallion</hi>, vol. 1, no. 5-9, <date value="1973-09">September 1973</date>, p. 2.</p></note> Gordon was 42 (ancient by Gay Lib's standards), a building contractor who lived in the Western suburbs. A big man [6'1', 14 stone], comfortable with his homosexuality but not very out, he decided, on hearing about the demo, that he wanted to be there. But not for him anything as mundane as catching a train. Rather he decided to run in to the city, and to carry a banner that he made for himself &#x2013; 2 foot square, black letters on green canvas that read 'I am proud of my homosexuality. Please change the repression against homosexuals and let us live in peace'. As he ran the eight miles through the streets of Sunshine, Tottenham and Footscray, he was cheered on and waved at by pedestrians and jeered at only twice! As one of those at the demo pointed out 'Everyone hoped that there would be a Gordon Doak, of course, because one of Gay Pride Week's objectives was to get members of the community to "come out"'. But no-one, not even the Gay Liberation organisers, expected it to happen with such a dramatic flourish. The fact that it did illustrated with startling clarity the success of the week'. And, we might add, prefigured the success of the movement.</p>

<p>The following photos from the Rennie Ellis Photographic Archive represent a remarkably important record of Gay Pride Week in Melbourne in <date value="1973">1973</date>. In the first place, the pictures are unique &#x2013; not even the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives has any significant images of that memorable week. And, equally important, Ellis has captured in a few shots a sense of the variety of politics at work. From a protest march through the streets, to Gordon Doak and his one-man banner, to the picnic in the park which so unsettled the police. And he captures, too, the playful use of graffiti and the playful-serious use of radical drag to challenge gender norms. Here we really do see how pictures may indeed tell thousands of words.</p>

Forty-eight photographs, 2 newspaper illustrations in album 32.3 &#x00D7; 26.2cm, <hi rend="c">Ltaf</hi> 191.</p></note> is a typical nineteenth-century photo album. It is a well used and loved object rather than a precious one that was hidden in a cupboard for only special viewings. It is a familial object that could be touched and closely looked at on a table or on the lap by oneself or with other family relatives. It holds photographs that are intensely intimate and, as pages were turned, a visual narrative unfolded of family life. The Smith family album, however, differs from the traditional photo album in that it also contains male nudes and a series of vignettes depicting masculine behaviours in a highly performative manner. The vignettes were also published in the <hi rend="i">Australasian</hi> weekly newspaper and, as such, the album holds photographs that bridge both the private and public worlds of the family photographic album.</p>
<p>The Smith Family Album is a rectangular shape, portrait rather than landscape in design, and measures 32.0 &#x00D7; 26.6 &#x00D7; 4.5cm with thick cardboard pages. It is actually a scrapbook, as the word 'Scraps' appears on the spine of the album. Whether the size of the photographs dictated the album size or vice versa is unknown. However, I suspect the compiler desired a more 'artistic' look to the album rather than a random snap happy one as the size and the layout of the photographs suggest an earnest amateur at work. The prints are 12.0 &#x00D7; 16.5 cm in size except for the newspaper clippings, which are 11.5 &#x00D7; 12.5 cm, and each page holds two photographs, which create a self contained narrative on the page.</p>
<p>The inclusion of male nudes in a family photographic album is both unusual and puzzling. In an attempt to provide some insight into their presence, I intend to question the traditional way of looking at these photographs by (re)framing them with a range of readings and meanings. Photography by its very nature is duplicitous and offers a multiplicity of readings depending on when, where and who is doing the looking. And in the nineteenth century, 'exemplary images of bodies could be made to mean many things and could be sexually charged or not depending on the viewer's disposition'.<note xml:id="fn330-87" n="4"><p><hi rend="sup">4</hi>Michael Anton Budd, 'Every Man a Hero: sculpting the homoerotic in physical culture photography', in Deborah Bright, ed., <hi rend="i">The Passionate Camera</hi>, New York: Routledge, <date value="1998">1998</date>, p. 53.</p></note> As the photograph is the material manifestation of the gaze I also want to query the presence of these nineteenth-century photographs depicting male closeness and that of the male

gaze captured within the context of the Smith family album. Are these images of nude boys and theatrical male bonding spectres of a homoerotic gaze?</p>
<p>I am interested in the identity of the creators of the album but only to a point, as it is not my intention to establish queer identities. Rather, it is to bring to light the existence of such erotically charged photographs in a family album and the slippage that occurs when the parameters of the image and the family album shift. Obviously the meaning of a photograph is crucially influenced by the moment of production but it is also subject to changes as the photograph(s) enters into new relationships with new circumstances and publics. It is important to examine the life of an image and in so doing reflect upon

<head>Shifting the Depicted Context</head>
<p>The photographs appear here without interruption as the landscape shots and other family pictures have been removed from the album. This alternative framework of presenting the album pages renders new significance to the juxtaposition of the images rather than altering the content of the photographs.</p>
<p>Ordinarily the group of 'Peacemaker' pictures would be considered as composing a series separate to the nude photographs, however, as they are held in the one family album they are interpreted as being part of an overall visual narrative. As we can see by the preceding images the accumulation of these pictures in the album starts to expose an ongoing theme or pattern.</p>

<head>Familial Space to Public Library</head>
<p>The provenance file tells us the album was presented to the State Library of Victoria on <date value="1979-12-10"><date review=" -10-10">10 December 1979</date></date> by a Mr Wilbur D. Smith and records 'Mr Smith resumes the right to remove [the album] temporarily for his own use'. A listing held with the album also describes the donation as an 'Album of photographs of members of the family of Mr. Wilbur D. Smith mostly taken in and around Lilydale, Seville and Brighton with some being the work of W.H. Smith of Seville'. The two newspaper illustrations &#x2013; the 'Peacemaker' and 'A Visitor from the Outstation' were published in the Australasian Sixth and Seventh Photographic Competitions in <date value="1899">1899</date> and <date value="1900">1900</date> respectively. They are by W. H. Smith, Seville.</p>
<p>The donor of the album is now deceased. However, some detective work has revealed that Wilbur D. Smith's father was in fact William Henry Smith ( W. H. Smith), the only accredited photographer in the album. Also we now know that the donor Wilbur D. Smith does not appear in the album as he was born in <date value="1911">1911</date>, several years after the fact. W. H. Smith is the only identified contributor to the album. I hasten to add, however, that the album does have a coherent visual style that is consistent with the published photographs 'Peacemaker' and 'A Visitor from the Outstation' and I consider it likely that W. H. Smith of Seville was the original creator and photographer of this photo album. 'W. H. Smith' is identified in one photo of two men seated in front of a weatherboard cottage. His name is written in pencil under a middle-aged man sitting on a chair with a newspaper on his lap. This label has been added after the original album captions which are in ink and a different handwriting. It is difficult to determine his family status, however he could easily be the father of the family or even a cousin or uncle. Could W. H. Smith have been simply a family friend? There is no definite answer here, however, I believe that he is most likely the photographer repeatedly behind the lens and it is his gaze that we encounter in the Smith family album.</p>

<head>Milieu of Late Nineteenth-Century Photography</head>
<p>The late nineteenth century in Australia was a time of enormous change heralded by industrialization and a growing urban population. Photography embraced these technological and cultural changes and emerged with a renewed and revitalised focus.</p>
<p>The practice of photography expanded considerably in the late nineteenth century with the advent of the Eastman Kodak pocket camera and the availability of bromidegelatin coated papers. These new photographic papers made enlarging a more practical and commercially attractive procedure as well as giving the photographer greater personal control and creative input over the finished picture. Prints could now be toned and highlights of the print could be strengthened or subdued depending on the artistic will of the photographer.</p>
<p>Instant photography using the pocket camera also meant that photography had entered the popular imagination. 'You press the button, we do the rest', was the Eastman
<pb xml:id="n99" n="99"/>
company's motto. By the <date value="1890">1890s</date> there were a number of Australian photographic trade journals available as well as photographers having access to English and American publications. With the advent of these publications photographers were now exposed to new camera technologies and professional applications as well as the opportunity to purchase the latest equipment and camera accessories. Amateur photographers now developed networks in which ideas were exchanged and images circulated freely. It was a time of great openness and serious amateurs now sought to use photography as a means of personal expression whether deciding to focus on the relationship between photography and private life or photography and art. Photographic competitions became popular and photographic societies also encouraged their members to experiment with different papers and toning to create artistic interpretations of their subject matter.</p>
<p>The serious amateur photographer still preferred to use a bellows camera on a tripod, shooting with dry plate negatives that dictated a more studied approach to taking a photograph and gave greater creative control over the final image. In contrast Kodak pocket camera users were quite happy to snap anything that took their fancy as they careered along on their bicycles &#x2013; another late nineteen-century phenomenon &#x2013; tour of the countryside.<note xml:id="fn331-87" n="5"><p><hi rend="sup">5</hi>'Notes for the Photo.

<head>Pictorialism</head>
<p>Even the most ordinary snapshot of the day was characterized by its nineteenth-century cultural coding. The amateur photograph of the late nineteenth century was based on a pre-existing image that was derived from the painting of the period and a new art movement in photography known as Pictorialism. In Australia, painters such as Streeton, Roberts and Bunny were influenced by the English Arts and Crafts movement, which was a revolt against the new age of mechanization and was a romantic effort to create art that was both beautiful and useful. Art Nouveau was to later emerge from this movement. Art in this era was already busy mythologizing a disappearing way of life in the bush and drew upon the mythic, idyllic, and iconic classical nude. It was a natural progression that Pictorialism in photography would also engage with similar subject matter.</p>
<p>Photographs came to mimic accepted motifs, practices and even formal qualities of painting. In the past 'the camera had previously been used for <hi rend="i">functional</hi> purposes, but now it was to become an <hi rend="i">aesthetic</hi> instrument, so that we had pictures for pictures' sake like the movement in painting of art for art's sake'.<note xml:id="fn333-87" n="7"><p><hi rend="sup">7</hi>Jack Cato, <hi rend="i">The Story of the Camera in Australia</hi>, Melbourne: Georgian House, <date value="1955">1955</date>, p. 147.</p></note> Prior to the <date value="1890">1890s</date> the standard photographic practice was to close down the iris of the camera lens that created a picture with sharp detail from approximately three feet to infinity. The Pictorialists on the other hand opened up the lens so that the focus of the camera concentrated on the key aspect of the subject and consequently diffused any other unessential details. Pictorialists veered
<pb xml:id="n100" n="100"/>
towards the 'idealist' preference for blurred images and naturalist settings and were often criticized for creating over romanticized works. Lionel Lindsay was one Australian painter who experimented with the new bromide-gelatin papers and produced Bromoil prints from a combination of ink pigments and oil paint with which he won medals for at the Photographic Society of New South Wales exhibitions.<note xml:id="fn334-87" n="8"><p><hi rend="sup">8</hi><hi rend="i">Ibid</hi>, p. 148.</p></note></p>

<head>The Nineteenth-Century Family Photographic Album</head>
<p>Photo albums first became popular with the arrival of calling cards, known as cartesde-visit. These were small photographs (11.4 &#x00D7; 6.4 cm) produced by professional studios in the late <date value="1850">1850s</date>. The size and function of the photographic album changed with advances in technology, and by the late nineteenth century amateur photographers were now grouping their photos for presentation in a structured manner comparable to verbal narratives, most commonly in (family) photo albums.<note xml:id="fn335-87" n="9"><p><hi rend="sup">9</hi>Andrew L.

Although the albums' ties to personal history and significant memory have been broken, they are now the supporting medium for what would otherwise be lost pictorial moments in history.</p>
<p>The family photographic album is a typical cultural relic and also a very personal item imbued with memories. The creators of the album are social biographers, so to speak, and as such construct narratives operating within everyday life. In the nineteenthcentury family albums can be seen as forms of the 'domestic museum'. The obsessive concern with their compilation is part of the nineteenth century fascination with using photography to establish a complete, objective and comprehensive social inventory in a period obsessed with taxonomy and social order.<note xml:id="fn336-87" n="10"><p><hi rend="sup">10</hi>Peter Hamilton, <hi rend="i">The Beautiful and the Damned: the creation of identity in nineteenth-century photography at the National Portrait Gallery <date value="2001-06-06">6 June</date>-<date value="2001-10-07">7 October 2001</date></hi>, Hampshire: Lund Humphries, <date value="2001">2001</date>, p. 147.</p></note></p>
<p>However, the family photo album does more than just preside over our most precious memories and extends beyond merely recording history.

<head>The Smith Family Album</head>
<p>A definite aesthetic photographic style runs through the Smith Family Album and alerts the viewer to the fact that the photographer had 'intent', reflected in the photographs' consistently well-balanced compositions and careful framing of images. There are no casual snapshots in the album and the only blurred movement in a frame comes from a flowing creek or restless pet. The subjects of the photographs are willing participants and where family members are photographed in everyday scenarios, time has been taken to compose the picture and for subjects to adopt poses.</p>
<pb xml:id="n101" n="101"/>
<p>It is possible that W. H. Smith belonged to a photographic society and, if not, he could easily have come in contact with aspiring amateurs and consequently been caught up in the excitement at the time. The album does in fact exhibit a visual style and content that is reflective of the pictorial photographic trends of the day in its formality and romantic depictions of bush life.</p>
<p>Photographs move through space and time and have a life of their own after their initial point of creation. Turning the pages of this album leads me to question the traditional codes of viewing sexuality and masculinity at the end of the nineteenth century. What meaning does the viewer ascribe to these family photographs when the album includes sensual images of nude young men in the outdoors adjacent to orchestrated pictures of men making peace after falling out over a game of cards?</p>
<p>Here was an album I had serendipitously discovered on one of my forays into the Pictures Collection storage area. The accession listing accompanying the album in no way indicated the 'nudity' contained therein, e.g. 'Taking sun bath' was described as '[Bathing youth reclining on fallen tree]', the words naked or nude never appear in the description of any of the photographs.</p>
<p>Had these pictures simply been overlooked or was it that few people had noticed or wished to consider the alternative framings or queer readings of these photos?</p>
</div>
<div xml:id="t1-g-t9-body-d8">
<head>Naked Youth and the Photographic Nude</head>
<p>The common assumption of the nineteenth century was that there was a vast difference between the nude and the undressed. The nude created an aesthetic impression whereas the naked subject drew attention to the lack of dress that dispelled any feelings of 'pure' aestheticism.<note xml:id="fn339-87" n="13"><p><hi rend="sup">13</hi>Angelo S. Rapport, <hi rend="i">Famous Artists and Their Models</hi>, London: Stanley Paul, <date value="1913">1913</date>, p. 18.</p></note></p>
<p>Kenneth Clark in <date value="1956">1956</date> drew upon this nineteenth-century assumption when he offered this characterization of the nude: 'to be Naked is to be deprived of our clothes, and the word implies some of the embarrassment most of us feel in that condition. The word "nude", on the other hand, carries, in educated usage, no uncomfortable overtone. The vague image it projects into the mind is not of a huddled and defenceless body, but a balanced, prosperous, and confident body: the body reformed'.<note xml:id="fn340-87" n="14"><p><hi rend="sup">14</hi>Kenneth Clark, <hi rend="i">The Nude: a study in ideal form</hi>, Garden City, New York: Doubleday Anchor Books, <date value="1956">1956</date>, p. 23.</p></note> Photographers had provided photographic nude studies of the human figure for artists since the <date value="1840">1840s</date> and articles on nudity in photography (largely written by men) had begun to appear in camera journals after <date value="1890">1890</date>. These articles suggested that young boys would make especially appropriate models because their bodies were less sensually provocative than those of women.

<p>The ideal male body in the later part of the nineteenth century was beautiful, good and heroic. Each was a quality that could be eroticized and generate an admiration of the masculine body consciously or not of a homosocial character. The heroism of youth was that of vulnerability associated with innocence &#x2013; the poseur's willingness to become

<p>'Meditation', 'The Cyclist's reviver', and 'Taking sun bath' are conspicuous photographs to the viewer as they are not a customary documentation of the 'fictive pictorial space' of the family album. Nor are they typical of records belonging to the social inventory of the family 'museum'. Nude males or naked youth do not figure largely in family photo albums. The identification of the subject of a photograph always dominates our perception of it. In each of these photographs the distance between the lens and subject varies, but it is the presence of the nude youth that arrests our vision. All three subjects are on logs in a bush setting, however, I think it would be fair to say that in this instance the native floras and fauna are of secondary interest. I suggest that here the photograph(s) is acting as surrogate for its image content. By this I mean the interest of the photographer/viewer is in the subject of the photograph, in this instance the male nude. Aesthetically, the Smith images are very much a cultural artefact of their era. The attempted neo-classical poses of the models in A Meditation' and 'The Cyclist's reviver' are not dissimilar to 'Evening' by F. Holland Day,<note xml:id="fn344-87" n="18"><p><hi rend="sup">18</hi>'Evening' in the <hi rend="i">Smithsonian Institute: the <date value="1896">1896</date> Washington Salon and Art Photographic Exhibition</hi>, <ptr target="mailto:http://americanhistory.si.edu/1896/p01.htm"/> (accessed <date value="2010-05-03">3 May 2010</date>).</p></note> although somewhat amateurish by comparison. At the turn of the century, Day's influence and reputation as a photographer rivalled that of Alfred Stieglitz. His firm of Copeland and Day was also the American publisher of Oscar Wilde's <hi rend="i">Salom&#x00E9;</hi>, illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley. 'Evening', like the
<pb xml:id="n103" n="103"/>
Smith album nude photos, maintains a respectable relative distance between the subject and the viewer, detracting from any close visual liaison with the 'other'.</p>
<p>The captioning of the nude photographs in the Smith Album is not playful or amusing, unlike those attached to other family photos in the album. The titles are more reflective and couched in the language of pictorial photography or classicism making them safer for public and family consumption. Reframing a photograph as 'art' in the nineteenth century made it secure from censure and the use of titles de-emphasized the potential of reading the body image erotically. This use of contextualizing images with romantic titles left the reading of the photograph in the eye of the beholder and how long the eye lingered was known only to the spectator.</p>
<p>The subject of a photograph is always of primary importance. However, its physical presence can also throw light on the photographer's intention and its use. The material traces of the photographs in the Smith family album also indicate that these pictures had another life before they were lodged in the album. 'Defying the monsoon' and 'Taking sunbath' have very distinct pinholes in each corner &#x2013; an indication that these two photographs have been pinned on a wall and viewed in another location. Whether this was a public or private place we do not know, just as we will never know the identity of the invisible spectator(s). Upon further investigation, I discovered other photographs in the album also had pinhole marks, however, these were less obvious.</p>
<p>'The Cyclist's reviver' also has faint pinholes in all four corners but more interestingly it has a grey lead pencil line and soft fold dividing the picture in half. This fold changes the composition of 'The Cyclist's reviver' favouring the nude and excluding the scenery to the right of the male model. The photo may have been folded to change the composition but also it may have been folded and placed in a book for safekeeping. Was it a keepsake? Did 'The Cyclist's reviver' now fit into the palm of a hand or pocket where it could be kept and discretely touched and looked at when so desired?</p>
<p>The Smith album has also had more than one owner and a secondary owner at a later date has labelled several photographs with pencil. I especially like the label given subsequently of 'Taking sunbath' which has penciled on the edges of the page 'young Les', an indication that for this owner of the album, the photograph was very much about family history &#x2013; the nudity seems to have passed them by.</p>

Questions arise, however, because within the context of this family album they provide evidence of slippage that may be occurring at the seams of nineteenth-century 'male same-sex intimacy and its complicated intersection of vision, aesthetics and desire'.<note xml:id="fn352-87" n="26"><p><hi rend="sup">26</hi>Potvin, <hi rend="i">Material and Visual Cultures Beyond Male Bonding</hi>, p. 2.</p></note></p>
<p>The <hi rend="i">Australasian</hi> newspaper illustrations sit opposite their original photographs in the scrapbook, being immediately preceded by the male nudes: 'Meditation', 'Cyclist's reviver', and 'Taking sunbath'. The pictures viewed in this immediate sequence run counter to the other family photos subsumed into the broader social narrative and cultural context of this album.</p>
<p>'The Peacemaker' and the earlier 'Peacemaker with an apology to Marcus Stone R.A.' are clear examples of such orchestrated 'touching' between men, which in this instance hinged on repairing 'friendships' after falling out over a game of cards. 'A Visitor from the Outstation' has no sanctioned touching but the languid pose of the man in the doorway draws one's attention.</p>
<pb xml:id="n106" n="106"/>
<p>The page bearing the most wear and tear in this album is the one that holds the two <hi rend="i">Australasian</hi> clippings: 'A Visitor from Outstation' and 'The Peacemaker'. Naturally these photographs would have been highly valued and shown to all and sundry as acknowledgement of the photographer's skill and the models accomplished posing. By contemporary standards the scenes appear stilted and highly mannered but the social actors in these pictures also appear to be relaxed and enjoying themselves. Apart from one character in 'Peacemaker with an apology to Marcus Stone R.A.' who appears to be on the verge of laughing, the amateur actors appear to be at ease with the photographer's directing and staging.</p>
<p>It was a surprise to discover that these particular photos in the album were not only performed for the camera but also staged for a newspaper photographic competition. The presence of the newspaper illustrations reinforces the uncertainty of vernacular photographs. For 'A Visitor from the Outstation' and 'Country or Bush Life' exist as both photographic historical objects of their time and also as a deliberate representation of the everyday nineteenth-century world. As Susan Sontage points out:
<quote><p>Although there is a sense in which the camera does indeed capture reality, not just interpret it, photographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are'.<note xml:id="fn353-87" n="27"><p><hi rend="sup">27</hi>Susan Sontag, <hi rend="i">On Photography</hi>, Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin Books, <date value="1979">1979</date>, p. 6</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>The seductive power of photography is, and always has been its capacity to offer multiple readings of images. Democratic in nature, it promotes a blurring of distinctions and a proliferation of meanings: 'Photography being the permissive medium that it is means that the trajectory of a photograph(s) can subsequently be invested with different values with each new reengagement.

<p><hi rend="c">In that Year</hi> of the revolution, <date value="1917">1917</date>, praise flowed for Edward Carpenter's <hi rend="i">Love's Coming of Age</hi>, a book whose mission was described as 'an attempt to remove the altar of love from present "dens of stuffy upholstery" to the high canopy of the stars'. And this praise came from none other than John Curtin, the noted Victorian Socialist Party's 'firebrand'. Curtin had just moved to Perth to become the editor of the <hi rend="i">Westralian Worker</hi> and to spread socialist politics in the West. Although never confirmed, Curtin, writing as 'Vigilant', also took over the role of the paper's book reviewer. 'Vigilant' thought the time was right to 'grasp firmly the nettle of social evils and particularly the immediate moment with its surfeit of sex-problem picture shows . . . to direct public attention to some really serious works upon the subject . . . <hi rend="i">Love's Coming of Age</hi> deals with the sexproblem in its every aspect'. <note xml:id="fn355-87" n="1"><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi>This material in this chapter is part of an ongoing project about the Australian Left and the Gay Liberation movement.</p>
<p>'Vigilant', 'Love's Coming of Age', <hi rend="i">Westralian Worker</hi>, <date value="1917-03-02">2 March, 1917</date>, p. 2 <ptr target="mailto:http://john.curtin.edu.au/fitzgerald/collection/pen4.html"/> (accessed <date value="2010-08-15">15 August 2010</date>).</p></note></p>
<p>While it's not entirely clear what the sex-problem was, 'Vigilant' argued strongly 'that the only ultimate complete solution of the sex-problem, bound up as it is with the economic dependence of woman, lies in the emancipation of society. This idea comes naturally to Socialists, who understand the nature of the economic serfdom of today and who cleave to the classic statement [by Engels]: 'Never shall this problem be solved until there lives upon this earth a race of youths and maidens who have never been obliged, nor even tempted, to enter a loveless match, nor deterred from entering a love match, through material motives &#x2013; considerations of social prestige on the one hand, or the necessity for a "home" on the other"'. <note xml:id="fn356-87" n="2"><p><hi rend="sup">2</hi>The quote is from Engels' <hi rend="i">Origin of the Family</hi> where he discusses what relations between people will be like under a future socialist society.</p></note></p>
<p>The book was, in 'Vigilant's' view, definitely challenging, with some 'daring tentative suggestions' which would probably prevent young people being allowed to read it. But he was having none of this, seeing it as suitable for adolescents, while adding that 'its sweet ideals' should be passed on by parents to their children, so that 'when their turn comes, they may approach the enchanted lands of love and marriage with fuller knowledge'. Although these 'daring tentative suggestions' must have included Carpenter's chapter on homosexuality &#x2013; or the 'intermediate sex' as he called it &#x2013; 'Vigilant' never directly refers to homosexuality.</p>
<p><hi rend="i">Ross's Monthly</hi> of that same year, however, wasn't so coy with its masthead claiming it was a magazine of 'Protest, Personality and Progress'. Published in Melbourne, it was racy newspaper &#x2013; racy of the soil (earthy) &#x2013; and it is not surprising that it tackled some of the 'hot-button' topics of the day. Heading its review 'A courageous sex book', <hi rend="i">Ross's</hi> reviewer wrote of <hi rend="i">Love's Coming of Age</hi>: 'There is a very illuminating chapter on <hi rend="i">The Intermediate Sex</hi> . . . [where] attention was first drawn to the subject about 30 years ago by Ulrichs, an Austrian. It is extremely interesting as a subject of investigation and a fuller
<pb xml:id="n108" n="108"/>
knowledge of it would lead to a considerable modification of our views on the subject of marriage and sex relations in general'. From this, the reviewer noted, Carpenter 'moves naturally to the discussion of the possibility of a Free Society'. <note xml:id="fn357-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi><hi rend="i">Ross's Monthly</hi>, vol. 2, no. 21, <date value="1917-08">August 1917</date>, p. 15. The monthly publication had close relations with the Victorian Socialist Party (<hi rend="c">Vsp</hi>) and often ran articles by its members, while the <hi rend="c">Vsp</hi>'s the <hi rend="i">Socialist</hi> regularly advertised <hi rend="i">Ross's</hi> and its articles.</p></note></p>
<p>As these writers indicate, sex, including homosexuality, was a compelling issue for the left, as it has continued to be. Others also have pointed to the rise of lesbian and gay rights in tandem with revolutions. One of the first examples is the French Revolution resulting in <date value="1791">1791</date> in the effective decriminalisation of homosexuality. The Napoleonic Code of <date value="1804">1804</date>, which was based on the ideals of the Revolution, was widely adopted throughout Europe. Equally influential was the Russian Revolution of <date value="1917">1917</date>, with its wide-sweeping changes affecting all aspects of life including the decriminalisation of homosexuality. In <date value="1920">1920</date> 17-year old Bolshevik David Khanin was already a leading member of the youth organisation Komsomol and fighting with the Red Army during the Civil War. In his memoirs he writes passionately when questioned why must he speak of sex: 'Is it because we didn't experience love? Because we lived as ascetics? In the name of revolution did we suppress in ourselves explosions of feeling and the flesh? No, a thousand times, no! We loved just as other generations'. In light of such declarations, it is no wonder historian Gregory Carleton writes of this time: 'People could not remain silent in the midst of a revolution that was the most audacious effort in history to give men and women freedom to live and love as they chose, to release them from the prejudices and restrictions of the past'.<note xml:id="fn358-87" n="4"><p><hi rend="sup">4</hi>Gregory Carleton, <hi rend="i">Sexual Revolution in Bolshevik Russia</hi>, Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, <date value="2005">2005</date>, p. 2; quote from Khanin, Carleton, <hi rend="i">Sexual Revolution in Bolshevik Russia</hi>, p. 4.</p></note></p>
<p>The events of <date value="1917">1917</date> also inspired socialists in Australia. Victorian Socialist Party (<hi rend="c">Vsp</hi>) member Amelia Lambrick noted, it was 'a time of rapid movement. Old methods, old ideas, old conceptions are in the crucible. Changes vital and far reaching are making themselves felt'. <note xml:id="fn359-87" n="5"><p><hi rend="sup">5</hi>Lambrick wrote a two-part article on the times, <hi rend="i">Socialist</hi>, <date value="1919-01-17">17 January 1919</date>, p. 3 and <date value="1919-01-24">24 January 1919</date>, p. 2; the quote is from 24 January.</p></note> On <date value="1920-10-26">26 October 1920</date>, twenty-six women and men from socialist groups, the Industrial Workers of the World (<hi rend="c">Iww</hi>) and some unionists from the New South Wales 'Trades Hall Reds' met in Sydney to form the Communist Party of Australia (<hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>).<note xml:id="fn360-87" n="6"><p><hi rend="sup">6</hi>The party used the initials <hi rend="c">Acp</hi> for much of its early days, but I have used the more familiar <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>. The <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> dissolved itself in <date value="1991">1991</date>, but two parties &#x2013; the Communist Party and the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist) &#x2013; currently claim descent from the original <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>. The <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>(<hi rend="c">Ml</hi>) looks to China as its socialist model.</p></note> It was a party that explicitly aligned itself with the Russian Revolution and saw itself as a dedicated activist revolutionary party.</p>
<p>The original manifesto outlined that 'The Communist Party is essentially a fighting organisation and not a debating club'. Adds its historian, Stuart Macintyre, 'The success of the Bolsheviks was taken to validate Lenin's insistence on the need to seize the revolutionary opportunity; the split in the ranks of the pre-war socialist international was seen as distinguishing those who made revolution, from those who merely talked of one'.<note xml:id="fn361-87" n="7"><p><hi rend="sup">7</hi>Stuart Macintyre, <hi rend="i">The Reds</hi>, St Leonards, <hi rend="c">Nsw</hi>: Allen &amp; Unwin, <date value="1998">1998</date>, p. 104.</p></note> With the working class the agents of change in Russia, the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>'s whole orientation was to this class. This led to significant differences between the new <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> and existing socialist groups such as the <hi rend="c">Vsp</hi>, some of whose members had been part of the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>'s original gathering. Without a clear-cut focus on the working class, the <hi rend="c">Vsp</hi> was to fold by <date value="1923">1923</date>, while the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> grew. <note xml:id="fn362-87" n="8"><p><hi rend="sup">8</hi>The Sydney-based Australian Socialist Party (<hi rend="c">Asp</hi>) played a bigger role in forming the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>, but it had earlier dissolved itself into the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>.</p></note></p>
<p>However, as the fledgling workers' state faced famine, war and the decimation of the working class, as well as Lenin's death, the situation in Russia deteriorated. From the mid-<date value="1920">1920s</date>, Joseph Stalin began his rise to power. Ruthlessly destroying all traces of the
<pb xml:id="n109" n="109"/>
revolution's gains and the politics that made them possible, Stalin transformed Russia into a state capitalist power.<note xml:id="fn363-87" n="9"><p><hi rend="sup">9</hi>This is a controversial position on Russia which this article cannot address. I refer readers to Tony Cliff in <hi rend="i">State Capitalism in Russia</hi>, London: Pluto, <date value="1974">1974</date>. Writings on this are available at the Marxist Internet Archive <ptr target="http://www.marxists.org"/>, <ptr target="http://www.swp.org.uk"/>, <ptr target="http://www.socialistworker.org"/> or <ptr target="http://www.sa.org.au"/>.</p></note> The much-vaunted freedom from prejudice and restriction of the early days came under attack as the Stalinist regime vigorously promoted the capitalist nuclear family, tighter divorce laws, restrictions on abortion and, in <date value="1934-03">March 1934</date>, the re-criminalisation of homosexuality.</p>
<p>Leon Trotsky, one of the Revolution's leaders, became a passionate opponent of Stalin and the changes in Russia. Among other criticisms, he attacked these backward steps in <hi rend="i">The Revolution Betrayed</hi>: 'the leaders are forcing people to glue together again the shell of the broken family and not only that, but to consider it, under threat of extreme penalties, the sacred nucleus of triumphant socialism. <hi rend="i">It is hard to measure with the eye the scope of this retreat'</hi>.<note xml:id="fn364-87" n="10"><p><hi rend="sup">10</hi>As quoted in Lindsay German, <hi rend="i">Material Girls: women, men and work</hi>, London: Bookmarks, <date value="2007">2007</date>, p. 180 (emphasis added).</p></note> Trotsky himself was, naturally, a target of Stalin &#x2013; in the end he was assassinated by one of his agents &#x2013; and became a hated figure in the Stalinised Communist Parties world-wide. Nonetheless, Trotsky's influence was not completely lost. Once in opposition to Stalin, he called for the formation of political groups around the world to carry on the revolutionary tradition he had been so much a part of establishing. Some of these groups were to play an important role in the <date value="1970">1970s</date> Gay Liberation Movement.</p>
<p>How did Australia's Communist Party and its members fit into this picture? Did they feel they too must speak of sex? Did they want to be part of that most audacious effort to give women and men freedom to live and love as they chose? Or, on the other hand, did they see no links between sexual liberation, Marxism and revolution? Are the critics, such as left-wing historian Eric Hobsbawm, correct in claiming that 'sexual liberation has only indirect relations with any other kind of liberation' and that socialist revolution led to totalitarian, highly repressive states, puritanism and 'a paralysing fear of love and eroticism'?<note xml:id="fn365-87" n="11"><p><hi rend="sup">11</hi>Eric J. Hobsbawm, <hi rend="i">Revolutionaries: contemporary essays</hi>, London: Quartet, <date value="1982">1982</date>, pp. 216-19.</p></note> With most of the world's communist parties toeing the Stalinist line by the <date value="1930">1930s</date>, did the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> become puritanical and repressive in its political expression?</p>
<p>The <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>'s position was complex. On the one hand, it was determined to champion the cause of women at work &#x2013; equal pay, working conditions, unionisation and the like. As well, it properly considered that issues such as birth control, marriage and prostitution were socialist concerns of importance for all workers. And for most of its existence the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> was way out in front of society on these questions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, like the Communist Parties around the world they ceased to be revolutionary. Instead heavily influenced by Soviet social conservatism, which mirrored that of Anglo/Western capitalism, they missed opportunities to take up the cause of minorities, such as that of homosexuals. One area of the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>'s principled and active support for minorities &#x2013; that of Aboriginal rights &#x2013; indicates what the Party was capable of. The Aboriginal cause more clearly fell within their working class, anti-ruling class focus and was often in response to action taken by Aborigines themselves. There were no similar working class demands voiced by homosexuals around rights at work until the <date value="1970">1970s</date>. Nor, until the late <date value="1960">1960s</date>, was there any Australian homosexual rights movement, despite the efforts of Communist Party member and poet Laurie Collinson in <date value="1958">1958</date> to

The Law Conference argued that adult homosexuality should not be a crime.</p></note></p>
<p>To return to the first decades of the twentieth century. The Communist Party was formed out of a socialist milieu that was outspoken on the questions of sex, sexuality and women's rights and took them up in their press and public meetings. Throughout this period &#x2013; and indeed up until the late <date value="1960">1960s</date> &#x2013; sexuality in the socialist, and later the communist press, primarily came up in five contexts: marriage, birth control, prostitution, venereal and other sexually transmitted diseases, and censorship. Homosexuality was rarely mentioned directly or positively until the <date value="1970">1970s</date>, but sometimes there were more veiled, mostly neutral, references.</p>
<p>Homosexuality never appeared openly in the pages of the <hi rend="c">Vsp</hi>'s publications, nor was the case ever put to change any of the criminal laws. In the mainstream press of its time (<date value="1906">1906</date>-<date value="1923">1923</date>), there were regular mentions of men charged with a variety of 'homosexual crimes', some on women who cross-dressed or even married other women, a few about lesbians and an article on a 'remarkable theory' of homosexuality.<note xml:id="fn367-87" n="13"><p><hi rend="sup">13</hi><hi rend="i">Adelaide Advertiser</hi>, <date value="1908-09-05">5 September 1908</date>, p. 5. Initially it was thought that homosexuality was rarely covered by the mainstream press, but more recent research continues to discover a richer history.</p></note> Edward Carpenter's first mention in the <hi rend="c">Vsp</hi>'s weekly paper the <hi rend="i">Socialist</hi> was a letter from him weighing in on the debate within the socialist movement around the question of general strikes. While the American radical poet Walt Whitman was praised for his working class poems and other writings, again no mention was made of his homosexuality or the homosexual references in his poems.<note xml:id="fn368-87" n="14"><p><hi rend="sup">14</hi><hi rend="i">Socialist</hi>, <date value="1906-12-15">15 December 1906</date>, p. 3; <date value="1906-12-22">22 December 1906</date>, p. 5. Several verses of Oscar Wilde's 'The Ballad of Reading Gaol' were reprinted in the <hi rend="i">Socialist</hi>, <date value="1907-02-02">2 February 1907</date>, p. 4.</p></note></p>
<p>There was one time when the <hi rend="i">Socialist</hi> did respond to the mainstream press coverage. 'Passing women', women who dress and live as men, have occurred throughout history and in Australia often during times of high unemployment. There have been a number of high profile cases, one of which was Marion (Bill) Edwards. In <date value="1906">1906</date>, the <hi rend="i">Socialist</hi> put her case as a strong argument for equal pay, rather than anything to do with sexuality. As the paper wrote: 'Marion Edwards who had been dressing in male attire for the last seven years is a Welsh girl. She says she first donned male clothes to enable her to get a living easier than she could as one of the gentler sex. Moral &#x2013; equal pay for equal work and thorough training for both sexes, with economic freedom for all'.<note xml:id="fn369-87" n="15"><p><hi rend="sup">15</hi><hi rend="i">Socialist</hi>, <date value="1906-10-20">20 October 1906</date>, p. 4. Edwards was, in fact, Australian born and had dressed as a man so successfully that she married several times. See Lucy Chesser, <hi rend="i">Parting with my Sex: cross-dressing, inversion and sexuality in Australian cultural life</hi>, Sydney: Sydney University Press, <date value="2008">2008</date>.</p></note> While this was a great way to argue for equal pay, it said nothing about homosexual emancipation.</p>
<p>In the socialist press books were routinely recommended for reading, including many about 'sex hygiene' and education though usually without mention of any homosexual content or the sexuality of the author. Havelock Ellis's <hi rend="i">Men and Women</hi>, Carpenter's <hi rend="i">Love's Coming of Age</hi>, Richard von Krafft-Ebing's <hi rend="i">Psychopathia Sexualis</hi>, along with Oscar Wilde's <hi rend="i">The Soul of Man Under Socialism</hi> and his <hi rend="i">Collected Works</hi>, were merely noted as a books for sale with no further comment or review. The <hi rend="i">Socialist</hi>, however, did refer readers to <hi rend="i">Ross's Monthly</hi> &#x2013; where they would have read about Carpenter's 'brave book', among other detailed book reviews.</p>
<p>Importantly, the book that is key to a Marxist analysis of women's oppression (and, hence, homosexual oppression), Frederick Engels <hi rend="i">Origin of the Family, Private Property</hi>

<hi rend="i">and the State</hi> was regularly referred to. There were frequent extracts and many articles based on the book, all a mark of how seriously the <hi rend="c">Vsp</hi> took the question of women. August Bebel's <hi rend="i">Women and Socialism</hi>, Eleanor Marx Aveling and Edward Aveling's <hi rend="i">The Woman Question</hi> and outspoken Bolshevik Alexandra Kollontai's books were also frequently referred to, with extracts printed in the paper's columns.</p>
<p>From <date value="1920">1920</date>, with regular articles in the Communist on the beacon of the Russian Revolution lighting the way for the future, the new Communist Party enthusiastically took up the cause for freedom and its publications constantly promoted the gains of the revolution for women in Soviet Russia and pointed to what could be won in Australia. International Women's Day &#x2013; the initiative of German Communist Clara Zetkin &#x2013; with
<pb xml:id="n112" n="112"/>
regular articles about its history and celebration around the world. Equal pay and the campaigns for it that reached through the Party's history were also covered in detail. The Party's publications frequently carried references to and extracts from all the books mentioned above, as well as selling copies of important texts. In <date value="1921">1921</date>, the <hi rend="i">Communist</hi> reported the sale of 21 copies of Kollontai's <hi rend="i">Communism and the Family</hi> at the Kurri Kurri coalfields in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>'s first foray into the questions of sexuality came on the front page of the first number of their paper the <hi rend="i">Communist</hi> (later <hi rend="i">Workers' Weekly</hi>, finally <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>) in an article by Adela Pankhurst entitled 'Communism and Social Purity: An Appeal to Women'. Pankhurst noted that if the Party ever became a force large enough to be feared by the capitalist class, 'we shall be associated in the press by accusations of "Free Love" and "Communism of Women"'. (Socialists had been attacked on this very basis, even before the Russian Revolution, with extensive misquoting from the <hi rend="i">Communist Manifesto</hi> by the anti-socialist forces.)</p>
<p>Pankhurst turned the accusations back on the capitalist class, arguing that 'profits and prostitution &#x2013; upon these Empires are built and Kingdoms stand'. Instead, though putting it somewhat more conservatively than the Russians envisaged, 'Communism will abolish prostitution . . . it will encourage purity and decent self-restraint. It will give young men and women the opportunity of marriage based on mutual love, because it will remove poverty and drudgery out of the lives of everyone'. Others such as Ella Morgan argued that communism would mean 'the very taste of life' for women and that 'if women become rebels, the revolution is in sight'.<note xml:id="fn370-87" n="16"><p><hi rend="sup">16</hi>Pankhurst in the <hi rend="i">Communist</hi>, <date value="1920-12-24">24 December 1920</date>, p. 1; Morgan in the <hi rend="i">Communist</hi>, <date value="1921-08-05">5 August 1921</date>, p. 6.</p></note></p>
<p>In fact the capitalist class in Australia was not idly sitting by waiting for the Communist Party to become a force. In the immediate post-<hi rend="c">Wwi</hi> period, the conservative Women's Reform League and National Council of Women organised against the perceived post-war instability. Citing the 'tremor of unrest that was threatening to upheave its [capitalism's] very foundations' and the Russian Revolution's 'sinister, disturbing influence even on the fundamental moral relationship', these groups were mobilising women in support of the 'private ownership of productive property as the cornerstone of democracy and civilisation itself and to impose the discipline necessary for a return to industrial stability'. They argued against young women's freedoms, calling for more women police, early hotel closing and 'guardians' in the factories. A typical scaremongering description of women's position in Russia after the Revolution was printed in the League's <hi rend="i">Woman's Voice</hi>:

strive to build working class women's political and industrial strength in opposition to such ruling class mobilisations. It was also constantly under fire from the State on other fronts. Censorship of books and journals, both political and non-political, fiction and non-fiction, was a constant. In <date value="1921">1921</date>, the Federal Government introduced a more broadly based ban on overseas publications.<note xml:id="fn372-87" n="18"><p><hi rend="sup">18</hi>This was more of a blow than it may seem at first as many Australian books were actually published in the <hi rend="c">Uk</hi>.</p></note> Obscenity and sedition laws were strengthened and <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> publications regularly denied the right to be sent through the post.

The <date value="1920">1920s</date> persecution culminated in raids of Party premises and its printing press in <date value="1929">1929</date>.</p>
<p>The beginning of the <date value="1920">1920s</date> was so inspirational, so hopeful for coming world-wide workers revolutions. There was also a freeing up of society's strictures, the appearance of the 'New Woman', women in education, adventurers and even, in Victoria, women like Alice Anderson who ran her own garage.<note xml:id="fn373-87" n="19"><p><hi rend="sup">19</hi>See Liz Ross, 'Flappers, Faculty and Fast Ladies', in Graham Willett, Wayne Murdoch and Daniel Marshall, eds, <hi rend="i">Secret Histories of Queer Melbourne</hi>, Parkville, Vic.: Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, <date value="2011">2011</date>; Georgine Clarsen, <hi rend="i">Eat My Dust</hi>, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, <date value="2008">2008</date>, pp. 104-119.</p></note> By the end of the decade, however, there was financial catastrophe, the defeat of the workers' revolution in Germany and the rise of fascism in Italy. With Stalin and his supporters entrenched in Russia, repression rather than freedom was the order of the day.</p>
<p>If the situation deteriorated in the late <date value="1920">1920s</date>, it was only to get worse in the <date value="1930">1930s</date>. Alongside the workers movement and socialist/communist groups, homosexuals and their organisations were targeted by the rising right-wing forces including many in the governments of the Western democracies. In Germany, where the biggest homosexual rights organisation existed, the Nazis quickly turned on them, burning their books, trashing their headquarters, murdering or sending them to concentration camps, or driving most of the activists into exile. This was an incalculable blow to the campaign for homosexual rights worldwide, putting out the fire before it could even start in places like Australia.</p>
<p>From the <date value="1930">1930s</date>, the combination of censorship, Nazism and Stalinism meant that, other than in the veiled way described above through mention of books by Carpenter, Wilde and others for sale at Communist Party bookshops, homosexuality was not mentioned again in any context in the Australian socialist or communist press until <date value="1953">1953</date>. <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> first directly uses the word homosexual in an article about censorship on 1 July of that year. Referring to a report of book-burning by officials at <hi rend="c">Us</hi> Consulates in Sydney and Singapore, it began: 'If you want to buy "Why Men Wear Female Clothing" or "Private Letters from Homosexuals to a Doctor" you can walk into any American bookstore and plunk down your 35 cents.

indication of the fact that, instead of World War II delivering freedom, most on the left found themselves, once again, more heavily repressed. The <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> was literally fighting for its life as it faced the ruling class offensive known as the Cold War. It had already been banned for a time during the War and, within a few years, faced yet another attempt. The use of laws such as the <hi rend="i">Crimes Act</hi> saw leading members jailed and the tight censorship that operated during the War and post-war years was not really lifted until the late <date value="1960">1960s</date>. Censorship was particularly pernicious in Australia and was seen as amongst the most draconian in the world. In a thorough analysis, Nicole Moore describes the censors' attitude as making Australia a 'bulwark for Anglo-Saxon standards', the Empire's 'moral core' and proud to ban material freely available in London or New York. The <date value="1950">1950s</date> Cold War rhetoric justified and encouraged the crackdown.<note xml:id="fn377-87" n="23"><p><hi rend="sup">23</hi><ptr target="http://www.austlit.edu.au/specialistDatasets/Banned/"/>; Nicole Moore <hi rend="i">Secrets of the Censors: obscenity in the Archives</hi>, <ptr target="http://www.naa.gov.au/about-us/research-grants/margaret-george-award/former/moore-paper-2004-old.aspx"/> (accessed <date value="2010-08-15">15 August 2010</date>).</p></note></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> was prepared to challenge the censors, not just legally and in campaigns, but also through its cultural activities which were often banned. In the <date value="1930">1930s</date> it began its Workers Art Club, later to become the New Theatre. Through the postwar decades they put on challenging plays, many written by local women Communists, and some famous overseas anti-war plays, many of which were reviewed in <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>, often sparking a spirited debate. Writers and leading members of the Party, such as Jean Devanny and Katharine Susannah Prichard, were noted for their controversial novels that tackled issues of abortion and marriage, and in her <date value="1935">1935</date> novel, <hi rend="i">Virtuous Courtesan</hi>, Devanny included lesbian and male homosexual characters.<note xml:id="fn378-87" n="24"><p><hi rend="sup">24</hi>I cannot do justice here to the great contribution by <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> writers, especially the women, to literature and theatre and the breaking with the restrictive stereotypes in the period from <date value="1930">1930s</date> through to the <date value="1960">1960s</date>. See Carole Ferrier, <hi rend="i">Jean Devanny: romantic revolutionary</hi>, Carlton, Vic.: Melbourne University Press, <date value="1999">1999</date>, and Michelle Arrow, <hi rend="i">Upstaged: women dramatists in the limelight at last</hi>, Strawberry Hills, <hi rend="c">Nsw</hi>: Currency Press, <date value="2002">2002</date>, for their excellent coverage. I will be dealing with this period in much more detail in a forthcoming book.</p></note></p>
<p>More seriously for the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi>'s political project, in the <date value="1950">1950s</date> came the news from Russia and its satellite states of events which began to expose cracks in the Soviet edifice. First came the uprisings in Poland and, more famously, Hungary, leading to deep divisions within the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> and mass resignations. Then, shortly after Stalin's death, came the bombshell of Khrushchev's revelations of Stalin's repressive and murderous regime. In fact, far from being dull as many describe or remember them, the <date value="1950">1950s</date> proved to be just as political and sexually challenging decade as that archetypal political period of the post-war era, the <date value="1960">1960s</date>.</p>
<p>Sexuality, although it had never entirely gone off the agenda as has been shown, was now flamboyantly displayed as the new rock-and-roll music craze hit the airwaves. Young people, called bodgies and widgies, who followed the equally flamboyant fashions, were backed by the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> when they were censured by the press. The Party recognised that 'attempts at individual expression as a form of personal revolt against capitalism are not peculiar to this generation'. They talked of the 'lairs and larrikins' of the early <date value="1900">1900s</date> who 'came good' in the fight against conscription in <date value="1916">1916</date>-<date value="1917">1917</date>; or the 'jazz babies' of the <date value="1920">1920s</date> who joined the struggles in the Depression, some becoming active socialists. They argued that the rebellious behaviour of young people in the <date value="1950">1950s</date> had a legitimate cause. 'Facing our bodgie boys right now is the threat of being conscripted for up to five years under the Menzies' National Service Bill and being sent to fight America's battles "anywhere in the world"'.<note xml:id="fn379-87" n="25"><p><hi rend="sup">25</hi><hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>, <date value="1951-02-22">22 February 1951</date>, p. 6.</p></note></p>
<pb xml:id="n115" n="115"/>
<p>But homosexuality was still a hidden topic. Novels, plays and non-fiction with lesbian and gay content or by known homosexual writers, such as Han Suyin's <hi rend="i">Winter Love</hi>, Radclyffe Hall's <hi rend="i">Adam's Breed</hi>, Oscar Wilde's works, the poetry of Laurie Collinson and Walt Whitman continued to be listed by <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> without once mentioning homosexuality. The paper ran a critical article about the Kinsey Report on women, having completely ignored Kinsey's earlier examination of male sexuality.</p>
<p>Throughout the <date value="1960">1960s</date>, as the Communist Party welcomed the youth uprisings such as those in France in <date value="1968">1968</date>, references to sex and, for the first time, drugs increased in its publications, and the Party started having meetings about these topics. But the word homosexual still did not appear. Instead the approach of the <date value="1950">1950s</date> continued, with its oblique references recognised only by those 'in the know'. In this they lagged even behind the Church of England and debate on some of the campuses. At Melbourne University in <date value="1964">1964</date>, the Debating Union considered the case for and against homosexual law reform and when the vote was taken it was 281 for, with 98 against.<note xml:id="fn380-87" n="26"><p><hi rend="sup">26</hi>Graham Willett, <hi rend="i">Living Out Loud: a history of Gay and Lesbian activism in Australia</hi>.

<p>However, unlike the Churches and despite some initial resistance, the <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> did get actively involved in the new liberation movements. In <date value="1969">1969</date> it was the Women's Liberation Movement. By <date value="1971">1971</date> Gay Liberation had made it into <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>.</p>
<p>Phil Carswell was one of the early Party members who argued Gay Liberation's cause. He describes a really exciting time: 'There was a bit of a shake up of the party &#x2013; with greenies and poofters and mad sheilas &#x2013; a general melee of change'. While most of the support came from <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> women who had been impacted by Women's Liberation, Phil believes most were not actually homophobic as they were progressive and open to challenges. 'I think what they saw was the fundamental oppression and the fundamental issues at stake here and said sure we don't particularly want to do it, but if it's an issue for you, go off and do it'. If anything it was arguing for progressive causes outside the Communist Party that activists like Phil found the going hardest.<note xml:id="fn381-87" n="27"><p><hi rend="sup">27</hi>Phil Carswell, Australian Lesbian and Gay Archive, Tape no. 251 (Brisbane, <date value="1966-07-11"><date review=" -11-11">11 July 1996</date></date>). Phil notes that he would not use the term 'mad sheilas' today and has nothing but praise for his <hi rend="c">Cpa</hi> sisters and comrades.</p></note></p>
<p>But the last word lies with Denis Freney, who as editor of <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> published on <date value="1971-05-26">26 May 1971</date> the paper's first pro-Gay article, entitled 'Gay Liberation', five months before Australia's first Gay Liberation group met.

<p>Winston Churchill rose to speak. His audience was friendly although he was at the time something of an outcast given his views on appeasement. The occasion was a dinner to mark the feast of St George in the Guildhall in London in <date value="1933">1933</date>, and an opportunity to be unashamedly English. Mindful of the microphones and the broadcaster he pondered what nervous anticipation he was provoking at the <hi rend="c">Bbc</hi> given his contrary views; but he settled the anxiety of some listeners by suggesting he had a more important topic, St George and his dragon, albeit repeated under modern conditions:
<quote><p>St. George would arrive in Cappadocia, accompanied not by a horse, but by a secretariat. He would be armed not by a lance, but with several flexible formulas. He would of course be welcomed by the local branch of the League of Nations Union. He would propose a conference with the dragon &#x2013; a Round Table Conference, no doubt &#x2013; that would be more convenient for the dragon's tail. He would make a trade agreement with the dragon. He would lend the dragon a lot of money for the Cappadocian taxpayers. The maiden's release would be referred to Geneva, the dragon reserving all rights meanwhile. Finally St. George would be photographed with the dragon (inset the maiden).</p></quote></p>
<p>Churchill's withering satire won from the assembled members of the Royal Society of Saint George rapturous applause and laughter. As the verse from a medieval mumming play at the head of this article shows the story of St George as a chivalrous, brave, victorious and very English saint had long and popular roots. It was collected by folklorist Gwen John from a group of boys in the coal mining districts of Derbyshire in <date value="1921">1921</date> and is evidence of an ancient tradition, one that normally had him clothed in armour as a crusader knight. How he came to be naked and on the forecourt of the Library is this story and it begins in a distant past.<note xml:id="fn384-87" n="2"><p><hi rend="sup">2</hi>Robert Rhodes James, ed., <hi rend="i">Winston S.

<p>St George appears to have been an early Martyr, probably a Roman soldier, executed during the persecution of Diocletian in 303, with his place of burial in the strongest tradition being at or near Lydda, now Lod in contemporary Israel. This simple tale was embellished with George martyred with increasing ferocity no less than three times by an enraged ruler called Dacian, each time miraculously resurrected before being beheaded. In 495 Pope Gelasius in <hi rend="i">De Libris recipiendis</hi> rejected these myths as impossible to believe whilst praising George as one of those saints 'whose deeds are
<pb xml:id="n117" n="117"/>
known only to God'. He was wise to do so, for the cult of St George had given rise to shrines, churches and monasteries across the Eastern Empire.<note xml:id="fn385-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi>Giles Morgan, <hi rend="i">St George</hi> Harpenden, Hertfordshire: Pocket Essentials, <date value="2006">2006</date>, pp. 20-21.

<p>The myth persisted and his shrine at Lydda was a must see for pilgrims. One pilgrim, Bishop Arculphus was shipwrecked on the shores of Iona, and his accounts of the Holy Land including myths of St George were recorded by the Abbot Adomn&#x00E1;n and sent to Bede at Jarrow. They were translated into Anglo-Saxon and expanded particularly in &#x00E6;lfric's <hi rend="i">Passion of St George</hi> dating from <date value="1000">1000</date>, the time of the earliest English shrines and churches dedicated to the saint. The Norman Conquest reinforced this devotion. The Abbot Austrulph wrote an account of another fortuitous shipwreck around 740 where a casket containing relics and letters of attestation was washed ashore. Among these was the jawbone of St George and a church to house this treasure was built in Brix in Normandy the first of many dedicated to the saint.<note xml:id="fn386-87" n="4"><p><hi rend="sup">4</hi>Giles Morgan, <hi rend="i">St George</hi>, p. 34.

<p>George's arrival in northern Europe coincided with the rise of Islam and his cult neatly continued in the new faith in the person of Al Khidr, or the Green Man. His shrines were a place of common intercession particularly in matters of fertility. This practice continues to this day, but was sorely tested through the crusades. The Normans and the English took St George as their patron with his cross of red on white, and stories of miraculous appearances at the head of the battle for Antioch in <date value="1098">1098</date> and the siege of Jerusalem in <date value="1099">1099</date> were added to his legend. St George at Jerusalem is used to illustrate a large fragment of a manuscript bible made at the Benedictine Abbey of St Bertin in St Omer around <date value="1190">1190</date> and the date of this manuscript is testament to the enduring appeal of the miraculous appearances especially in the wake of the fall of the city to Saladin in <date value="1187">1187</date>.<note xml:id="fn387-87" n="5"><p><hi rend="sup">5</hi>The Hague, <hi rend="c">Kb</hi>, 76 F 5 Picture Bible (prefatory cycle preceding a Psalter?).

<p>In England the feast of St George was raised to the highest status in <date value="1222">1222</date>, and Edward III assured his place as a patron saint with the establishment of the Order of the Garter around <date value="1348">1348</date>. Such courtly and chivalric use was reflected in popular culture. The traditions of St George were compiled in <hi rend="i">The Golden Legend, Readings on the Saints</hi> made by Jacopus de Voragine in the mid thirteenth century. Widely copied across Europe, its account of George tells the story of a Dragon terrorising a city, its very breath capable of spreading the plague. It was placated with beasts until all were gone, being replaced with children chosen by lot. This fate befell the princess and despite the King's pleas, she was led to her doom. Enter George who, under the sign of the Cross, subdues the dragon, leading it back to the city by the princess's girdle before cutting off its head. The entire populace convert to Christianity and despite the offer of half the wealth of the Kingdom, the noble, virginal saint rides off into the sunset. There follows the account of George's triple martyrdom and Voragine concludes with his appearances in the crusades. Similar stories appear in the surviving copies of Scottish and English Legendaries or lives of the saints. With the advent of printing, <hi rend="i">The Golden Legend</hi> was soon in many editions in many languages. The State Library of Victoria holds a complete copy printed in <date value="1476">1476</date> by Johann Sensenschmidt in Nuremberg and fragments from seven other examples including the <date value="1493">1493</date> reprint by Wynken de Worde of Caxton's English translation of <date value="1483">1483</date>.

<p>The chronological ordering of the variant legends by Voragine gives the Dragon centre stage, and the largest part of the story. It is in fact the last of the myths added to St George and draws on Indo-European traditions, including <hi rend="i">Perseus and Andromeda</hi>, the story of the Spinning Maiden in the Persian Book of Kings, and older Babylonian creation myths. The Dragon is the animation of evil and an English example of the translation of St George to the great scriptural allegory of good and evil can be seen in an illustrated <hi rend="i">Apocalypse</hi>.

<p>St George is represented in Europe as an armoured knight, and examples of pre-Reformation religious art in Britain that survived the iconoclasm follow this convention. Evidence exists in the form of a coin of the high place of St George as a symbol of state. The gold Noble issued between <date value="1526">1526</date> and <date value="1529">1529</date> as part of Cardinal Wolsey's currency reform has St George on the obverse as a mounted knight spearing the Dragon and on the reverse the Ship of State with the cipher H and K for Henry and Katherine. The events of the King's divorce explain the rarity of the coin and while the feast of St George was demoted in the Reformation, Henry's piety, love of chivalry and use of the Garter as a form of patronage ensured that St George remained an English saint, and in literature he continued to thrive. Traditions like the Mumming Play found their mirror in the poetry of Spenser's <hi rend="i">Fairie Queene</hi> (<date value="1590">1590</date>) or more popular forms like the <hi rend="i">Famous Historie of the Seven Champions of Christendom</hi> (c.<date value="1596">1596</date>) by Richard Johnson, which told a very English story of St George and continued to be published well into the eighteenth century. In <date value="1599">1599</date> Shakespeare in the context of uncertain succession and a losing war in Ireland, drew on the memory of a famous victory and completed the reformation of St George as the personification of Crown and country in Henry V's great call to arms: 'Cry God for Harry, England and St George'.<note xml:id="fn390-87" n="8"><p><hi rend="sup">8</hi>James Bugslag, 'St Eustace and St George: crusading saints in the sculpture and stained glass of Chartres Cathedral', <hi rend="i">Zeitschrift f&#x00FC;r Kunstgeschichte</hi>, 66 bd, h. 4, <date value="2003">2003</date>, pp. 441-464.</p>

in the care of a Reformed Minister, his second infatuation began on his Grand Tour and lasted the rest of his life. Cupid's arrow struck 'on the fifteenth of <date value="1764-10">October 1764</date> as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol while the barefoot fryars [sic] were singing Vespers in the Temple of Jupiter' and the product of this union was <hi rend="i">The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</hi>.</p>
<p>The first volume was attacked by critics for its treatment of Christianity as being both an influence on and product of the decline, and it is in the second volume that Gibbon identifies a heretical fourth century Bishop of Alexandria as the historical St George. After describing his death at the hands of a mob, Gibbon concluded thus:
<quote><p>The odious stranger, disguising every circumstance of time and place, assumed the mark of a martyr, a saint, and a Christian hero; and the infamous George of Cappadocia has been transformed into the renowned St George of England, the patron of arms, of chivalry, and of the garter.</p></quote></p>
<p>Gibbon's empirical view of Christianity explains his dismissal of George, but later scholars identified a credible, earlier veneration of the Saint and this attempt at a literary iconoclasm failed to take hold.<note xml:id="fn392-87" n="10"><p><hi rend="sup">10</hi>David Womersley, 'Edward Gibbon <date value="1737">1737</date> &#x2013; <date value="1794">1794</date>', <hi rend="i">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</hi> online edition, consulted on <date value="2010-05-06">6 May 2010</date>.

imperial ambitions. The last volumes were published just before the French Revolution and the upheaval of both events gave the moral of Gibbon's story a contemporary relevance: the corruption of commerce and the allure of its consort luxury had destroyed the virtue of the Roman Empire; while the rise of Napoleon with his adoption of the style and symbols of ancient Rome celebrated its militarism and dictatorship. In Britain the minds of the artistic community, the literary and gentlemen intellectuals, turned to Classical Greece as the touchstone of permanent values linked to more attractive ideals of the aristocratic democracy of the Athens of Pericles.<note xml:id="fn393-87" n="11"><p><hi rend="sup">11</hi>Boyd Hilton, <hi rend="i">A Mad, Bad and Dangerous People?: England <date value="1783">1783</date> &#x2013; <date value="1846">1846</date></hi>, Oxford: Clarendon Press, <date value="2008">2008</date>, p. 1.

<p>Since <date value="1732">1732</date> the Society of Dilettanti had fostered a gentlemanly intellectual interest in Greek art and culture but war gave more immediate opportunities. The defeat of the French Fleet at the Battle of the Nile in <date value="1798">1798</date> and the eventual expulsion of Napoleon from Egypt in <date value="1801">1801</date> won favours for Britain from the Ottoman Empire. The Ambassador to Constantinople, Thomas Bruce, Earl of Elgin and of Kirkaldine, took advantage of the change in atmosphere to obtain a <hi rend="i">firman</hi> from the Ottoman government to the Governor of Athens permitting explorations at the Acropolis. Elgin had proposed an artistic mission be funded by the British government as part of his embassy, and when this was refused he funded it, pursuing his interest in classical Greece intending to use resulting drawings and casts 'to improve the Arts in Great Britain'. Now his agent, Philip Hunt, used the <hi rend="i">firman</hi> and bribes to further this ambition, excavating the Acropolis and removing sculptures from the Parthenon and surrounding buildings. After two years the assembled treasure accompanied Elgin on his return journey but Napoleon had him imprisoned, attempting to extract the sculptures to add to his war booty in the Louvre in return for his release. Elgin finally returned to London in <date value="1806">1806</date> placing the sculptures in a temporary gallery in his house. Their display divided opinion. Byron castigated their removal from the Acropolis as an act of vandalism, while artists, especially the Royal Academy, praised them as the finest examples of classical art. Deeply in debt, Elgin attempted to sell the collection to the State, but negotiations dragged on, affected by the changing fortunes of the war.<note xml:id="fn394-87" n="12"><p><hi rend="sup">12</hi>William St Clair, 'Thomas Bruce (<date value="1766">1766</date> &#x2013; <date value="1841">1841</date>)', <hi rend="i">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</hi> online edition, consulted <date value="2010-05-06">6 May 2010</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>Waterloo changed everything. Britain emerged triumphant and as gifts of dinner services and art made their way to London from grateful monarchs for the Duke of Wellington, so too did artists and sculptors in search of new patrons. One such refugee was Benedetto Pistrucci. Born in Rome in <date value="1783">1783</date>, Pistrucci showed early talent as a gem engraver and sculptor and Napoleon's sisters were among his patrons. On arrival he was introduced to Sir Joseph Banks, then president of the Royal Society. Banks employed him to make a bust and while sitting for Pistrucci, was interrupted by his friend Richard Payne Knight, a wealthy gentleman member of Parliament and prominent member of the Dilettanti. He rose to prominence with his seminal work <hi rend="i">An Account of the Remains of the worship of Priapus</hi> in <date value="1786">1786</date>, <hi rend="i">and</hi> from this unlikely beginning developed his collection of antiquities and place as a critic, sealing his pre-eminence with the <date value="1805">1805</date> publication of <hi rend="i">An Analytical Enquiry into the Principles of Taste</hi>. His visit to Banks was to show his latest purchase, the finest antique cameo in existence. Pistrucci proved that he in fact
<pb xml:id="n123" n="123"/>
had made it and this revelation made him. Knight and Banks promoted his genius and he was appointed by William Wellesley-Pole, Master of the Royal Mint and older brother of the Duke of Wellington, to the position of Chief Engraver, over the head of William Wyon who was given the lesser position of Assistant Engraver. The Wyon family had held the position of Chief Engraver for successive generations and this snub, keenly felt, combined with Pistrucci's foreign origins to become the source of bitter controversy.<note xml:id="fn395-87" n="13"><p><hi rend="sup">13</hi>Graham Pollard, 'Pistrucci, Benedetto (<date value="1783">1783</date> &#x2013; <date value="1855">1855</date>) <hi rend="i">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</hi> online edition, consulted <date value="2010-01-08">8 January 2010</date>.

<p>Meanwhile Elgin frustrated with his lack of success in selling his collection to the British Museum, petitioned Parliament to investigate his acquisition of the marbles, his right to their property, and the price at which they should be acquired for the nation. The government, mindful that the Crown Prince of Bavaria had placed a large sum in a London bank to secure them, agreed, and in <date value="1816-02">February</date> and <date value="1816-03">March 1816</date> a Select Committee sat to hear evidence on the matter. It became a debate over artistic merit, and Richard Payne Knight's dismissive opinions were countered by impressive arguments from members of the Royal Academy, a turning point for professionals over gentlemen amateurs in matters of taste. The Report recommended purchase at &#x00A3;35,000, less than half of what Elgin had spent, and concluded that Elgin had acted with the consent of the Turkish government and tacit consent from the Greek population '. . . so far from exciting any unpleasant sensation, the people seemed to feel it as the means of bringing foreigners into their country, and having money spent amongst them'. The final paragraph of the report reveals a political motivation. Noting how the small republic of Athens had achieved greatness in science, literature and philosophy the Committee concluded:
<quote><p>. . . no country can be better adapted than our own to afford an honourable asylum to these monuments to the school of <hi rend="i">Phidias</hi>, and of the administration of <hi rend="i">Pericles</hi>; where secure from further injury or degradation, they may receive that admiration and homage to which they are entitled, and serve in return as models and examples to those, who by knowing how to revere and appreciate them, may learn first to imitate and ultimately to rival them.</p></quote></p>

<p>Pistrucci was commissioned to engrave a medal to commemorate the purchase, and while this was never cast, another design was to have wider and lasting influence. Britain had temporarily abandoned the gold standard during the Napoleonic wars, and the coinage had deteriorated. A new gold sovereign was planned, and Pistrucci suggested St George and the Dragon for the reverse to symbolise the victory over Napoleon. The design of the coin drew on his earlier cameos and showed the influence of the Elgin Marbles, especially the Parthenon frieze. Pistrucci transformed St George from an armoured knight to a naked athlete, reputedly modelled on an Italian servant at Brunet's Hotel in Leicester Square, and George the Greek replaced George the Roman, with the perfection of the naked human form, normally reserved for pagan deity transferred to Christian sanctity, marking a high point in British Hellenism. The image was encircled with that most English symbol, the Garter, replete with its motto <hi rend="i">Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense</hi>.<note xml:id="fn397-87" n="15"><p><hi rend="sup">15</hi>H. N.

<pb xml:id="n124" n="124"/>
<p>The coin was first issued in <date value="1817">1817</date> and the accession to the throne of George IV in <date value="1821">1821</date> saw some minor changes including replacing a broken spear with a short sword and the removal of the garter. Meanwhile tensions at the mint continued to simmer. Pistrucci was commissioned to design a medal to commemorate Waterloo for presentation in gold to the four coalition monarchs and in silver to Wellington and Blucher. The payment of &#x00A3;1,750 was enough to excite jealousy, but it was his refusal to copy portraits by other artists that brought him undone. Wellesley Pole resigned as Master of the Mint in <date value="1823">1823</date> and the new Master, Thomas Wallace made Pistrucci Chief Medallist, replacing him with William Wyon as Chief Engraver. Neither was happy, as Wallace simply combined the salary of both the old Chief and Assistant Engraver positions and divided it equally for the new roles. Wyon took revenge on the reverse of the sovereign. St George and his dragon were banished, replaced with a more conventional heraldic shield. Pistrucci took revenge by spinning out his commission on the Waterloo medal, doubling his original fee. By the time the dies were complete in <date value="1844">1844</date>, only Wellington was still alive. Considered by many the finest medal ever designed it was never cast in its intended gold and silver forms.</p>
<p>Taste was changing and neo-gothic was replacing neo-classical. The reviewer in the <hi rend="i">Gentleman's Magazine</hi> of the <hi rend="i">Memoir of the Life of William Wyon</hi>, ridiculed Pistrucci's St George and his short broad sword as 'a weapon totally useless against his fell antagonist; indeed the hero appears rather to be thwacking the flanks of his affrighted horse with a bat or a battledore, than assailing his enemy'. He argued that if 'reverses strictly heraldic should occasionally be abandoned, and the Patron of the Garter appear on our coin, he should be encased in the armour which the middle age assigned for him'. The decision to rebuild the Palace of Westminster in Neo-Gothic marked this turning point in architecture, and Albert, Prince Consort to the new Queen Victoria, chaired the commission charged with its interior decoration. His association with the Gothic Revival belies a broader interest, for in <date value="1844">1844</date> he privately commissioned William Wyon to design a St George medal. Albert sat for his portrait for the obverse and Wyon, showing none of Pistrucci's sensibilities over copying, adapted his rival's design for the reverse in a reprise of classical St George. At 23 centimetres in diameter, the medal is much larger than the sovereign, giving Wyon's St George a more sculptural form and the active thrust of the spear into the Dragon created more drama and life.<note xml:id="fn398-87" n="16"><p><hi rend="sup">16</hi>N.

<p>Wyon exhibited the models for the medal at the Royal Academy in <date value="1844">1844</date> and the finished medal in <date value="1845">1845</date>. There is evidence that Albert chose it as a present for his eleven closest collaborators in the Great Exhibition of <date value="1851">1851</date> but only one was struck in gold and given to Sir Charles Dilke (first Baronet) as Wyon died in that year. Pistrucci died four years later and in art St George returned to gothic form. Dante Gabriel Rossetti designed a set of stained glass windows retelling the legend of St George made by Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co. in <date value="1862">1862</date>. His St George is a smooth and beautiful English youth modelled on the artist Charles Augustus Howell and shown in battle with a Dragon replete with a hairy belly and chest!

Jones made a series of seven paintings between <date value="1866">1866</date> and <date value="1867">1867</date> on the same theme for the dining room of his fellow artist Myles Birkett Foster. This St George appears effete in his youthfulness fighting an almost puny Dragon and was inspired by a 16th century woodcut in the British Museum. Both depictions followed Richard Johnson's account in <hi rend="i">The Seven Champions</hi> and have the saint in more personal combat, but it is a different personal combat that saw the return of the classical St George.<note xml:id="fn399-87" n="17"><p><hi rend="sup">17</hi>A set of the Rosetti designed windows is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum see: http:// collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O8439/panel/.

<p>In <date value="1871">1871</date> the sovereign was reissued with Pistrucci's design on the reverse. Modified by Leonard Wyon, son of William, the reappearance of the Grecian athlete marked a new interest in a more physical culture. Thomas Arnold's reforms of Rugby School, his son Matthew's promotion of the Greek ideal, and the promotion of a 'muscular Christianity' by Charles Kingsley and Thomas Hughes combined personal male prowess with Christian mission, where the battles of Empire could be rehearsed on the playing fields of the English public school. St George was enlisted to this Imperial cause on the standard on which its wealth was based, and in a mark of its reach a branch of the Royal Mint was established in Sydney in <date value="1871">1871</date> and then in Melbourne in <date value="1872">1872</date> to be closer to the source of gold. Not everyone shared enthusiasm for the new order. John Ruskin, spiritual father of the Pre-Raphaelites, despaired of the depersonalising, fragmenting society increasingly evident in industrial Britain. In <date value="1871">1871</date> he founded the Guild of St George to support more craft based, personal and sincere forms of production, beginning his long correspondence of ninety-six letters known as <hi rend="i">Fors Clavigera</hi> to 'the workmen and labourers of Great Britain' in which St George recurs time and again in his familiar form as the champion of good against evil. His advocacy supported a return to handcraft in printing, furniture design and fabrics at odds with an increasingly mechanised world.<note xml:id="fn400-87" n="18"><p><hi rend="sup">18</hi>The Pistrucci design for the reverse was adopted by Order in Council on <date value="1871-01-14">14 January 1871</date>.

year lease on Burlington House at &#x00A3;1 per annum was significant public support. By <date value="1876">1876</date> it had become an effective cartel. The forty-two Academy members could by right show up to eight works in the Annual Exhibition, and after they and their Associate Members had taken the best positions the opportunity for others was limited. The glittering banquet to open the Exhibition, held on or near St George's Day, was an opportunity for artists to impress themselves on patrons and in <date value="1876">1876</date> three princes, a Maharajah, members of the aristocracy and the Archbishop of Canterbury sat either side of the President, Sir Francis Grant. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli was called upon to speak. Conscious of the debate raging he flattered his audience by suggesting that politicians had little to offer artists, asserting to cheers that 'by Fine Arts public taste is created and taste is an important element in the character of a nation', before proceeding to list the achievements of government in shaping such taste. The National Gallery, and the presence of 140 art schools across the country were given as examples and from these 'it is no exaggeration to say we may expect very considerable results as regards the national taste and manufacturing skills'. Disraeli's passive view of Art as a moral and practical influence on the manufacturing wealth of the nation, contrasted with Dilke who sought wider participation, greater public involvement and a more open administration of the Academy. Dilke's motion failed drawing the comment from the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> that 'Complaints have existed in every country against any similar Institution; but on the whole, the public are satisfied with the administration of the English Academy'.<note xml:id="fn402-87" n="20"><p><hi rend="sup">20</hi>Holger Hoock, <hi rend="i">The King's Artists</hi>, pp. 300-7; <hi rend="i">Times</hi>, <date value="1876-05-01">1 May 1876</date>, p. 12; <hi rend="i">York Herald</hi>, <date value="1876-05-01">1 May 1876</date>, p. 6; <hi rend="i">Times</hi>, <date value="1876-05-10"><date review=" -10-10">10 May 1876</date></date>, p. 9.</p></note></p>
<p>One artist exhibiting in <date value="1876">1876</date> who may have had reason for dissatisfaction was Joseph Edgar Boehm. Born in Vienna in <date value="1834">1834</date>, his father was director of the Imperial

mint and owner of a substantial art collection. Early education was followed by a period at Art School in London, where he sketched the Elgin Marbles, later returning to Vienna to study medal design and follow his father's career. Rejecting this path he spent three years in Paris and was influenced by the work of realist sculptors, returning to London, newly married, in <date value="1862">1862</date>. He established a portraiture practice achieving early notice for a small sculpture of William Makepeace Thackeray which showed the novelist in contemporary costume and an informal pose breaking with the neo-classical toga draped forms prevalent at the time. His prolific output included animal sculpture, especially horses in which he excelled. In <date value="1869">1869</date> he carved a marble portrait of Victoria for Windsor Castle, and began accepting private commissions from the Queen and training Princess Louise in sculpture. Boehm first exhibited at the Royal Academy in the year of his arrival in London, and was a regular in the annual exhibition. In <date value="1875">1875</date> he exhibited to great acclaim his portrait sculpture of Thomas Carlyle, with whom he had formed a close friendship.</p>
<p>Despite success Boehm was passed over for Associate membership of the Academy, the prerequisite for full membership. Professional jealousy over his Royal commissions, combined with his foreign origins is the probable cause with Thomas Woolner as his main opponent. Boehm's contribution in <date value="1876">1876</date> was the great St George and the Dragon. Modelled in plaster it was a speculative venture, without an obvious patron. The choice of an idealised subject following so closely on his success with the realist <hi rend="i">Carlyle</hi> was a public statement that his range extended beyond portraiture and a claim for recognition by the Academy. From surviving correspondence with Carlyle it is clear that Boehm

was seeking to represent a great struggle, but the work was hardly original. He revisited an earlier horse sculpture for St George's mount, and the group is strikingly similar to the medal commissioned by Prince Albert from William Wyon; scarcely known to the public but known to Boehm by virtue of his Royal connections. Whatever the intent or inspiration, the critics and the Academy remained unmoved by Boehm's excursion to the neo-classical.<note xml:id="fn403-87" n="21"><p><hi rend="sup">21</hi>Mark Stocker, 'Boehm, Sir (Joesph) Edgar (<date value="1834">1834</date> &#x2013; <date value="1890">1890</date>)' <hi rend="i">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</hi> online edition, consulted on <date value="2010-01-11"><date review=" -11-11">11 January 2010</date></date>.

<p>While Art and politics and the politics of art mixed unhappily in Britain, across the Atlantic a more celebratory air prevailed. As Parliament was debating Dilke's motion, the great Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia was declared open. Conceived in the aftermath of the Civil War it was a statement of national confidence one hundred years after the Declaration of Independence. Seven months and over ten million visitors later, the Exhibition closed, with the editor of the <hi rend="i">Philadelphia Enquirer</hi> reflecting that:
<quote><p>For the first time in our history we became hosts to the civilised world, and
<pb xml:id="n129" n="129"/>
challenged all countries to place their productions side by side with ours. In many cases when art entered into the subject of competition, the Old World had the better of the New. But in other cases we not only held our own against our older rivals, but excelled them. We have seen what they can do, they have seen what we can do, and the results of such seeing cannot but be beneficial to the peoples of both worlds, giving each more respect for the other.</p></quote></p>
<p>As a sign of respect for the old enemy, the British exhibits occupied a central section in the main hall at the Exhibition and the Birmingham manufacturer Elkington and Company was prominent. Beginning in the <date value="1830">1830s</date>, the firm perfected electroplating in <date value="1840">1840</date> and with this new technology capitalised on a growing middle class and expanding empire in need of tableware. By <date value="1876">1876</date> the firm was a perfect example of the meeting of Art and Industry desired by Disraeli with fine reproductions of antiques held by the British and South Kensington museums, and elaborate centrepieces, trophies and sculptures added to their range. Their display was accompanied by a handsome publication with a glowing account by the pre-eminent journalist George Augustus Sala, and in the opinion of one observer they were '. . . the gem of the British Exhibit. Some splendid bronzes are included in it and one may pass hours inspecting the objects displayed by this enterprising firm, whose exhibit is valued by the London Times at $500,000'.<note xml:id="fn404-87" n="22"><p><hi rend="sup">22</hi><hi rend="i">Philadelpia Inquirer</hi>, <date value="1876-11-11"><date review=" -11-11">11 November, 1876</date></date>, p. 4.

<p>The display caught the eye of the officers of The Society of the Sons of St George, Philadelphia. Established on <date value="1772-04-23">23 April 1772</date> for '. . . the advice and assistance of Englishmen in distress', its early progress was interrupted by the War of Independence and after an intermission of eleven years the Society reformed with membership limited to men of English origin or descent and counting Benjamin Franklin among their number. By the time of its centenary in <date value="1872">1872</date>, the Society was confident enough to seek permanent and grand premises. The purchase of a large mansion for $70,000 in <date value="1875-02">February 1875</date> on the corner of Thirteenth and Arch Streets met this desire, and after improvements costing a further $149,356, including the addition of a grand Ionic portico, the building was dedicated on the Feast of St George in <date value="1876">1876</date>.</p>
<p>On the night following the opening of the Exhibition, the Hall was the venue for a banquet hosted by Sir Edward Thornton, British Ambassador to the United States, together with the British Commissioners, including Sir Redmond Barry as Commissioner for the Colony of Victoria, in honour of the President and Vice-President of the United States, members of the Administration and Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil. For all its grandeur, the officers of the Society clearly felt the Hall lacked ornament, for they placed an order with Elkington's for a bronze of St George, and in May the following year a sculpture depicting the Saint in battle with the Dragon, after Pistrucci's design, was placed on top of the new Portico.<note xml:id="fn405-87" n="23"><p><hi rend="sup">23</hi>Theodore C.

<p>Two monumental nude St George sculptures appeared in the space of a year. While Boehm's owed a debt to William Wyon's design it was made in the name of high art, and remained in plaster; whereas the Philadelphia St George mimicking Pistrucci's design and made by an unknown artist was cast in bronze as a product of industry. Both are
<pb xml:id="n130" n="130"/>
testimony to revival of the classical George on the principal coin of the realm and its wide acceptance as the familiar image of the Saint.</p>
<p>In the Royal Academy Exhibition of <date value="1877">1877</date> another male nude sculpture representing struggle was shown, this time to great acclaim. Sir Frederic Leighton's <hi rend="i">Athlete Wrestling with a Python</hi> was an instant success, purchased by the Chantry Bequest for the National collection, and exhibited the following year in Paris at the Exposition Universelle where it won a gold medal. Leighton's nude, charged with eroticism, introduced naturalism and energy and while owing a debt to <hi rend="i">Laoco&#x00F6;n and his</hi> Sons, it broke free from staid neoclassicism becoming the first of what became known as 'New Sculpture' suggesting that Boehm's <hi rend="i">St George</hi> from the previous year may be the last of the 'old'. Leighton's success was crowned in <date value="1878">1878</date> with his election as President of the Royal Academy, and he used this position to meet the challenge of the Grosvenor Gallery by revitalising Academy membership. His friend Boehm became one of the new Associates and took another step forward in <date value="1880-12">December 1880</date> with his appointment as Sculptor in Ordinary to the Queen. The office had been unoccupied since <date value="1864">1864</date> and the appointment formalised what had become a near monopoly in private Royal commissions. In <date value="1882">1882</date> Boehm was finally elected a full member of the Academy.<note xml:id="fn406-87" n="24"><p><hi rend="sup">24</hi>Christopher Newall, 'Leighton, Frederic, Baron Leighton (<date value="1830">1830</date> &#x2013; <date value="1896">1896</date>), <hi rend="i">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</hi> online edition, consulted on <date value="2010-07-19">19 July 2010</date>.

<p>Boehm's increasing stature was recognised in a profile written by Wilfred Meynell for the <hi rend="i">Magazine of Art Illustrated</hi> in <date value="1880">1880</date><hi rend="i"></hi>, and his first lectures as a Member of the Academy were published in <hi rend="i">The Architect</hi> in <date value="1882">1882</date>. Taken together they give some insight into his thinking. Meynell describes Boehm's art as that of a 'man of his time . . . neither an imitator of the antique, nor an ultra realist' and quotes his disdain for the brilliantly executed depictions of poverty and frailty favoured by Italian sculptors. Meynell continues: 'According to Mr. Boehm, we cannot be Greeks, for we have no mythology. Our art must be Christian and modern' and quotes Boehm decrying mere copying of the classical style or its famous works while praising his contemporary portraiture. In his lectures entitled 'Portraiture in Sculpture' Boehm's historical account praises the Greek as the high point of the classical with everything that imitated this derided. The Dilettante are dismissed as '. . . a pernicious and odious parasite, as desirable to be exterminated in the fields of Art as the Colorado beetle or <hi rend="i">Phylloxera</hi> in the fields of Nature', and Canova's famous nude depiction of Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker is ridiculed and likened to an African chief wearing a militiaman's Busby and spring side boots as proof of his heroism. Meynell's article has two illustrations of Boehm's work: a small engraving of his memorial portrait of Lord John Russell, exhibited at the Academy in <date value="1880">1880</date>; and a full page engraving of <hi rend="i">St George and the Dragon</hi>, still extant in plaster. <hi rend="i">St George</hi> was clearly an important part of his oeuvre to that time, modern because of the familiar image on the sovereign and given its Christian subject acceptable in its neo-classicism.<note xml:id="fn407-87" n="25"><p><hi rend="sup">25</hi>William Meynell, 'Our Living Artists . . .', illustration of St George and the Dragon, p. 337.

<p>Boehm's St George and the Dragon reappeared at the Royal Academy Exhibition in <date value="1885">1885</date>, this time as a bronze. It was not a commission and Boehm's investment in casting suggests he still liked it, as well as reflecting the fact that he was very busy. He was in his sixth year of a protracted design of a new effigy of Queen Victoria for the
<pb xml:id="n131" n="131"/>
coinage, had begun work on a memorial to the first Duke of Wellington to be placed at Hyde Park Corner and in October accepted a commission from the Government of New South Wales for a new sculpture of the Queen, all of these competing with numerous smaller commissions. The <hi rend="i">Times</hi> expressed disappointment at the standard of sculpture in the <date value="1885">1885</date> Academy, particularly from younger artists, but expressed satisfaction that 'Mr Boehm has given us, as might be expected, a fine horse and a spirited St George'. Other critics were less charitable with Edmund Gosse perceptively suggesting that the group was based on a small sketch and 'mechanically enlarged to its present bigness' and F. T. Palgrave deriding the figure of St George as:
<quote><p>. . . well poised in torso and limbs, a figure which might have alighted from a steed in the Elgin frieze, disports himself overmuch as a dandy; if dressed he might adorn a drawing room, but, here in the nude, as if ready for the circus, he is not a saint, nor quite a sinner.</p></quote></p>
<p><hi rend="i">St George</hi> found no buyer, and Boehm continued to recycle works. In <date value="1887">1887</date> a life sized marble version of an earlier smaller bronze <hi rend="i">Young Bull and Herdsman</hi> appeared at the Royal Academy. This work dates to <date value="1868">1868</date> and in <date value="1871">1871</date> Boehm exhibited a life sized plaster at the London International Exhibition advertising that a plaster copy could be had for &#x00A3;500 and a bronze for &#x00A3;<date review="1000">1000</date>. There were no takers then, and the later marble version with mixed reviews, remained unsold. A new opportunity to exhibit and market both sculptures presented itself in Melbourne with the Centennial Exhibition of <date value="1888">1888</date> and both works joined paintings, drawings and other sculptures that formed the British Art Exhibition at that momentous event.<note xml:id="fn408-87" n="26"><p><hi rend="sup">26</hi><hi rend="i">Times</hi>, <date value="1885-06-08">8 June 1885</date>, p. 4. Mark Stocker, <hi rend="i">Royalist and Realist</hi>, pp. 290, 299-302.</p></note></p>
<p>In their report to the Queen, the British Commissioners for the Exhibition explained that in addition to the vast array of manufactures to be exhibited they were mindful of 'the growing appreciation of works of art that distinguishes Your Majesty's Australian subjects' and after serious consideration they concluded 'that nothing would be so likely to promote the general success of the Exhibition as an exceptionally good collection of works of art'. After a grant of &#x00A3;5000 from the Melbourne Committee defraying the costs of crating, freight and insurance the collection of 174 paintings, 163 drawings, 264 engravings and etchings and 6 sculptures made their way to Melbourne. The Exhibition opened on the first of <date value="1888-08">August 1888</date> with the British Art Exhibition given pride of place in the upper gallery of Joseph Reed's great main building. Similar exhibits from France, Germany and Belgium were displayed in the annexes that covered much of what is now Carlton Gardens.</p>
<p>Boehm's sculptures were too heavy to join the rest of the British exhibits and were placed in the main transept close to the Dome. They were featured in an article in the <hi rend="i">Argus</hi> of <date value="1888-09-11"><date review=" -11-11">11 September 1888</date></date> with an illustration of the <hi rend="i">Young Bull and Herdsman</hi> as an example of his realism. The <hi rend="i">St George</hi> was seen as evidence of his recognition of the 'grandeur of the antique spirit in plastic art' having all 'the monumental impressiveness if not of the old Greek sculpture, so full of energetic action where conflicts had to be represented' then perhaps equal to 'the works produced in Italy at the time of the
<pb xml:id="n132" n="132"/>
Renaissance', and an engraving of the work featured in the <hi rend="i">Illustrated Australian News</hi> in the same week. If the newspapers were quick to report, Boehm was even quicker to sell. The minutes of the meeting of the Trustees of the Public Library, Museums and National Gallery of Victoria held on the <date value="1888-08-22">22 August 1888</date> record: 'A letter from Mr Boehm describing the Bull and Herdsman and the St George exhibited at the Exhibition was laid on the table' with the resolution 'the groups to be purchased for &#x00A3;<date review="2000">2000</date>'.<note xml:id="fn409-87" n="27"><p><hi rend="sup">27</hi><hi rend="i">Report of the Royal Commission for the Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition of <date value="1888">1888</date> to the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty</hi>, <date value="1889">1889</date>, pp. 11-12; 'List of works', pp. 107-124. <hi rend="i">Argus</hi>, <date value="1888-09-11"><date review=" -11-11">11 September 1888</date></date>, p. 34. <hi rend="i">Illustrated Australian News</hi>, <date value="1888-09-15">15 September 1888</date>.

<p>Eighteen-eighty-eight was a good year for Boehm in the colonies. In January the sculpture of the Queen commissioned for Sydney was unveiled before a crowd of 50 000 and to rapturous praise, despite Boehm having breached a condition of the commission by making a replica of the same figure for Balmoral Castle. But by November and in driving rain, his fortunes had turned. The monument to the first Duke of Wellington was unveiled and the critical response was muted. Boehm's attempts to please the many interests on the Committee resulted in a lifeless figure on a static mount with four soldiers representing England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales added, and looking, like an afterthought. Combined with the derision that greeted his portrait of the Queen for the Jubilee coinage in the previous year, his reputation suffered and with it his health. His elevation to a Baronetcy in <date value="1889">1889</date> indicated continuing Royal favour, but the death of his wife in <date value="1890-09">September 1890</date> added to his burdens and he died suddenly on 12 December in the same year. Princess Louise was present at his death and inconsolable, sparking vicious gossip about their relationship, leading to the destruction of all of his papers, and despite a funeral and burial in St Paul's, his place in the history of English sculpture soon faded to obscurity.<note xml:id="fn410-87" n="28"><p><hi rend="sup">28</hi>Mark Stocker, <hi rend="i">Royalist and Realist</hi>, pp. 105-108 (Sydney sculpture); pp. 149-167 (Wellington Memorial); pp. 243 -279 (Jubilee coinage); and article in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>.</p></note></p>

<p>At their meeting in the following July the Trustees considered the sixteen entries. It was an extraordinary list of subjects, many from 'sculptors' who have escaped record in any of the annals of Australian art and sadly with them illustrations of their entries. Two St Michaels jostled for attention with St Martin and the Beggar; a sculpture entitled 'The Amazon Slaying a Lion' competed with one called Archilles Slaying the Amazon' and continuing the mythical theme G. R. Davies entry of 'Pygmalion and Galatea' contrasted with the recommendation of 'a lover of art' that the sculpture represent 'Androcoles and the Lion'. Nationalist themes like 'Australasia' or 'Advance Australia' contrasted with the abstract 'In Articulo Mortis', and the enterprising R. Kretschman entered 'Lady Godiva', 'Coeur de Lion' and An Australian Pioneer'. Charles B. Richardson, a recognised artist, also suggested this latter theme and a photograph of his maquette showing a stockman with his hand sheltering his brow astride a squatting horse survives in an article about his work in the <hi rend="i">Magazine of Art.<note xml:id="fn411-87" n="29"><p><hi rend="sup">29</hi><hi rend="i">A History of the Society of the Sons of St George</hi>, pp. 56-77. <hi rend="i">Philadelphia Public Art</hi> at <ptr target="http://www. philart.net/person.php?id=38"/>, consulted <date value="2010-03-15">15 March 2010</date>. <hi rend="i"><ptr target="http://Phillyskyline.com"/></hi> at <ptr target="mailto:http://phillyskyline.com/stgeorgeshall.htm"/>, consulted <date value="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</date>.

Mackennal's career was just taking off following a depressing few months in England where he shared a flat with Richardson and Tom Roberts and attended the Sculpture School of the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia for his first public commission of relief sculptures for the fa&#x00B8;ade of the Victorian Parliament and the Library competition presented a chance for an idealised sculpture. His proposal was a careful contrapuntal design to mirror the spiral that defines Boehm's <hi rend="i">St George</hi>, an extraordinary creation as described in the <hi rend="i">Illustrated Australian News</hi>:
<quote><p>Truth is represented as a female figure seated on a winged horse which is in the act of ascending, while Error, defeated, lies prostrate on the ground. An image of
<pb xml:id="n134" n="134"/>
Victory poised on an orb, and sustaining the laurel crown, is held aloft by Truth, and symbolises the triumph which has been achieved.</p></quote></p>
<p>In the view of the journalist '. . . the figures are admirably modeled, and the group as a whole displays both vigour and artistic taste'. No less than Sarah Bernhardt agreed as quoted in the <hi rend="i">Argus</hi> of 11 July: 'If Mr Mackennal will take this model to Paris &#x2013; he is buried alive here &#x2013; and will execute it life size in marble or bronze it will place him on the high road to fame and fortune. The work is simply magnificent in taste, composition, arrangement and executive skill'. Mackennal took her advice and left for Paris where <hi rend="i">Circe</hi> rather than <hi rend="i">Triumph of Truth</hi> made his reputation. Tom Roberts revived the controversy in a remonstrance about the failure of the Trustees to support Australian artists, but despite this St George remained alone.<note xml:id="fn412-87" n="30"><p><hi rend="sup">30</hi>Noel S.

<p>The Felton Bequest for the purchase of works of art gave the means to acquire a companion. Lindsay Bernard Hall, Director of the Gallery on the first buying trip abroad met Emmanuel Fr&#x00E9;miet and after considering his sketch for a <hi rend="i">Perseus and Andromeda</hi> and the possibility of his <hi rend="i">St George</hi> which Hall thought would make a 'most novel and interesting contrast', settled on a variant of his <hi rend="i">Jeanne D'Arc</hi>. The variation was required for Fr&#x00E9;miet to keep bare faith with his <date value="1889">1889</date> contract with the Philadelphia Museum of Art which has a copy, not to further reproduce this work, and in <date value="1906">1906</date> a fifth casting in a third variation was installed at the front of the Library. The plinth was modelled on the original <hi rend="i">Jeanne D'Arc</hi> in the Place des Pyramides in Paris, and St George was given one to match with the sculptures placed on the paved apron in front of the portico. In <date value="1938">1938</date> the forecourt was redesigned and the two sculptures were soon at the top of new diagonal steps where they remain. Boehm's other work <hi rend="i">The Young Bull and Herdsman</hi> was not so lucky, falling victim to the <date value="1941">1941</date> purge of unwanted art under Daryl Lindsay, condemned to a ruinous outdoor existence at the Melbourne Show grounds. Its image remains a ghost in the Library in the bull and boy in the <date value="1929">1929</date> Napier Waller mural <hi rend="i">Peace after Victory</hi> at the top of the Dome marble stairs. Perhaps in an echo of Lindsay's taste, early representations of Roy Ground's fa&#x00B8;ade of the new National Gallery on St Kilda Road showed Fr&#x00E9;miet's <hi rend="i">Jeanne D'Arc</hi> standing in lone vigil, but whatever the separating dreams of architects, <hi rend="i">St George</hi> and <hi rend="i">St Joan</hi> have remained together.<note xml:id="fn413-87" n="31"><p><hi rend="sup">31</hi>Two plaster <hi rend="i">Busts</hi> by Boehm were removed from the collection in <date value="1943">1943</date>.

<p>An unlikely couple. Some see significance in the partnering of patron saints of England and France, while the story of the naked saint would suggest otherwise. Conceived as the symbol of English victory over France he is a challenge to the Maid of Orleans burned at the stake by English Catholics for witchcraft. <hi rend="i">St George</hi> has inspired artists. Peter Corlett recalls on leaving the Museum as a boy being struck by the statue and the fact that someone had made it, beginning his path to a career as a sculptor. But a more modern inspiration gives the pairing a new significance. Viewed from behind Boehm's <hi rend="i">St George</hi> is a harmony of spheres, with the perfect muscularity of the naked saint paired with a cross-dressing St Joan to symbolise a Gay and Lesbian Melbourne, a world their creators and champions could not have conceived.</p>

<p><hi rend="c">On</hi> <date value="1986-12-08">8 December 1986</date> over 300 friends and colleagues of Barrett Reid gathered at the Heide Museum of Modern Art to help him celebrate his 60th birthday and his life. Painters had been as much a part of it, as had writers. The tributes on this memorable occasion reflected his life-long passions. A book entitled <hi rend="i">A Flash of Life</hi><note xml:id="fn414-87" n="1"><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi>Shelton Lea and Robert Harris, <hi rend="i">A Flash of Life</hi>, Mountain View, Vic.: Christine Webb, <date value="1986">1986</date>.</p></note> was compiled by fellow poets Shelton Lea and Robert Harris and it contained a diverse selection of poems and drawings by writers and artists who had known Barrett Reid over many decades.</p>
<p>Reid was a visionary who had an illustrious career in the library and literary world. He was a highly skilled and experienced professional who had a major impact on public library development, both in city and country areas in Victoria from the late <date value="1950">1950s</date> to the <date value="1980">1980s</date> and beyond. He was an experienced political negotiator and consummate politician and the very strong network of public libraries in Victoria today is mainly due to his vision, leadership, dedication, commitment, determination and drive. He was also a man of many talents: a man of letters, a man of culture and a man of nature. He was a poet, an editor of literary magazines, a writer and book and art critic.</p>
<p>From the <date value="1940">1940s</date> until his death in <date value="1995">1995</date>, Reid worked closely and socialized with many notable artists, painters, writers, musicians, poets, filmmakers, politicians and bureaucrats at local, state, national and international levels. His portrait was painted by Sidney Nolan in <date value="1947">1947</date> after their trip to Fraser Island while Albert Tucker painted portraits of him in <date value="1983">1983</date> and <date value="1984">1984</date>. There are also countless photographic portraits of Reid by well-known photographers and many poems written about him, and for him, by notable writers.</p>
<p>Over the years, Reid was lovingly called 'Half angel, half devil,' (by Ruth Cowen),<note xml:id="fn415-87" n="2"><p><hi rend="sup">2</hi>Philip Jones, <hi rend="i">Art &amp; Life</hi>, Crows Nest, <hi rend="c">Nsw</hi>: Allen &amp; Unwin, <date value="2004">2004</date>, p. 4.</p></note> 'The young Rimbaud' (by Vida Horn),<note xml:id="fn416-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi>Vida Horn, 'Barjai Days', <hi rend="i">Overland</hi>, no. 142, <date value="1996">1996</date>, p. 36.</p></note> 'Lord Barrett' (by Shelton Lea),<note xml:id="fn417-87" n="4"><p><hi rend="sup">4</hi>Shelton Lea, <hi rend="i">The Paradise Poems</hi>, Greensborough, Vic.: Seahorse Publications, <date value="1973">1973</date>.

<p>As a young man, Barrett Reid lived a bohemian and controversial life in Brisbane during the <date value="1940">1940s</date> and this period in his life has been extensively researched and documented.<note xml:id="fn420-87" n="7"><p><hi rend="sup">7</hi>Graham Willett, 'Moods of Love and Commitment: Laurence Collinson in Melbourne', <hi rend="i">La Trobe Journal</hi>, no. 83, <date value="2009-05">May 2009</date>, pp. 77-90; Richard Haese, 'The Revolutionary years', <hi rend="i">La Trobe Journal</hi>, no. 30, <date value="1982-12">December 1982</date>, pp. 25-28; Joanne Watson, 'Brisbane's Little Chelsea: the cultural legacy of the Barjai and Miya groups', <hi rend="i">Overland</hi>, no. 174, <date value="2004">2004</date>, pp. 58-62.</p></note> But one major aspect of his life since coming to Melbourne in <date value="1951">1951</date> became almost totally overshadowed because he ensured that his sexuality and his romantic relationships were not public knowledge and did not become part of the public arena.</p>
<p>Piecing together the last 13 years of Barrett Reid's public, professional and personal life has been challenging and very similar to putting together a jigsaw. People's memories change and fade and many of his contemporaries are no longer alive. It has also been important to look at the critical circumstances in his life before retirement in order to understand the transformation and revitalization that occurred afterwards. The key factor that has been taken into consideration when writing about Reid was to respect the

extreme protectiveness he had for his private life. Barbara Blackman, (ne&#x00E9; Patterson) a close friend of Barrett Reid's for 50 years, described him as, 'enfant terrible in his saucier moments' who was always a pillar of society.<note xml:id="fn421-87" n="8"><p><hi rend="sup">8</hi>Barbara Blackman, <hi rend="i">Glass After Glass: autobiographical reflections</hi>, Ringwood, Vic.: Penguin, <date value="1997">1997</date>, p. 119.</p></note></p>
<p>In his last years living at Heide, he sorted through his correspondence to ensure that the public record was clean of anything controversial. In the five major interviews recorded during <date value="1981">1981</date>-<date value="1995">1995</date> there is no mention of his sexuality, his personal relationships and romantic loves. This careful separation of his private life from his public life was summed up by Stephen Murray-Smith, founding and long-standing editor of <hi rend="i">Overland</hi> when giving his speech at Barrett Reid's 60<hi rend="sup">th</hi> birthday: 'he is both a public figure with an intensely-lived private life, and a private man with an extraordinary public life'.<note xml:id="fn422-87" n="9"><p><hi rend="sup">9</hi>Stephen Murray-Smith, 'Speech given at Barrett Reid's 60<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Birthday', <hi rend="c">Pa</hi> 95/161, Box 72, Barrett Reid Papers, <hi rend="c">Ms</hi> <date review="1333">1333</date>9, <hi rend="c">Slv</hi>.</p></note></p>

<head>Compatible and contrary loves and contradictions.</head>
<p>Barrett Reid was a highly charismatic man who had more than one persona. He was a paradox and a chameleon<note xml:id="fn423-87" n="10"><p><hi rend="sup">10</hi>'The Face: Helen Elliott meets Philip Jones', <hi rend="i">Australian</hi>, <date value="2004-04-17">17 April 2004</date>, p. 10.</p></note> &#x2013; a man of contradictions. He had many passions, many lovers and countless friendships and relationships, both in his personal and his professional life.</p>
<p>Very early in his teenage years living in Brisbane he developed a reputation as a rebellious non-conformist. He was one of the founding editors of the <hi rend="i">Barjai</hi> magazine and part of an avant-garde group of young artists and writers. It was a period of time in Brisbane and other Australian cities where a bohemian and homosexual sub-culture was being developed and when literature, art and music interacted.<note xml:id="fn424-87" n="11"><p><hi rend="sup">11</hi>Clive Moore, <hi rend="i">Sunshine and Rainbows: the development of gay and lesbian culture in Queensland</hi>, St. Lucia, Qld. : University of Queensland Press, <date value="2001">2001</date>, pp. 120-123.</p></note> Barbara Blackman gives wonderful descriptions of the key members of the <hi rend="i">Barjai</hi> and Miya group &#x2013; writers and artists such as Laurie Collinson, Vida Horn (ne&#x00E9; Smith) Thea Astley, Cecel Knopke, Laurence Hope and many others. Barbara was a young poet at the time and captured the true essence of Barrett Reid in the <date value="1940">1940s</date>:
<quote><p>Barrie Reid was the essential romantic hero, verging on vain &#x2013; but with a rascally wit. Straight, [sic] handsome, with a fall of blond hair above engaging blue eyes, he was the helmsman, the front runner, in his soft commanding voice electrifying us with his paper on the artist in the modern world . . . or reading his own personal, well-formed poems.<note xml:id="fn425-87" n="12"><p><hi rend="sup">12</hi>Blackman, <hi rend="i">Glass After Glass</hi>, p. 109.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>She also described the 'big brother' relationship she had with him:
<quote><p>For years Barrie and I had been seen as the perfect couple, a pose that suited us both, he homosexual and I virgin. Not being able to marry me himself, he made it his mission to introduce me to a succession of brilliant young men.<note xml:id="fn426-87" n="13"><p><hi rend="sup">13</hi>Lesley Harding and Kendrah Morgan, <hi rend="i">Sunday's Kitchen</hi>, Carlton, Vic.: The Miegunyah Press, <date value="2010">2010</date>, p. 181.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>In <date value="1951">1951</date> Barrett Reid decided to leave Brisbane because, as a homosexual, he felt restricted and under pressure. In an interview in <date value="1995">1995</date> he recalled:
<quote><p>Brisbane was quite close, arid and stifling . . . Police would stop a man in the street if he wore suede shoes or a yellow jumper &#x2013; a pretty stifling environment . . . Brisbane was highly provincial.<note xml:id="fn427-87" n="14"><p><hi rend="sup">14</hi>Helen Topliss, interview with Barrett Reid, writer and editor, <date value="1995-04-17">17 April, 1995</date>, Heide.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>Reid hitchhiked to Melbourne with painter friend Laurence Hope. However, it should be remembered that in the <date value="1940">1940s</date>, it was not just Brisbane, but post-war Australia
<pb xml:id="n139" n="139"/>
that was narrow, xenophobic, homophobic and supremely intolerant. Reid soon found that Melbourne during the early <date value="1950">1950s</date> was no different from Brisbane: 'I thought I'd left a small town in Brisbane. I found I was still in a small town with a pretty narrow society'.<note xml:id="fn428-87" n="15"><p><hi rend="sup">15</hi>Edgar Waters, interview with Barrett Reid, writer, editor and libraria<hi rend="i">n, <date value="1986-10-30"><date review=" -01-30">30 October 1986</date></date>, Heide</hi>.</p></note> When he started working at the Public Library of Victoria (now the State Library of Victoria) he described the atmosphere as 'purely Dickensian', and bitterly resented the whole culture of censorship, self censorship and restricted access to materials in the library collection. <note xml:id="fn429-87" n="16"><p><hi rend="sup">16</hi>Ibid.</p></note></p>
<p>Reid's homosexuality was no secret in the <date value="1940">1940s</date> in Brisbane, but he chose not to publicly 'come out' in Melbourne once his career in librarianship was established (possibly because of the extreme conservatism of the State Library of Victoria and of Melbourne in the <date value="1950">1950s</date> and <date value="1960">1960s</date>). It was 13 years after his retirement that he publicly declared his homosexuality, and this was after his death in his only book of verse, <hi rend="i">Making Country</hi>, published posthumously but carefully prepared by Reid before he died. In this revealing collection of poems, he described his lovers, his passions, his friendships and his thoughts on life, nature and death. Stephen Williams in <hi rend="i">Overland</hi> described it as 'a fine self-portrait'.<note xml:id="fn430-87" n="17"><p><hi rend="sup">17</hi>Stephen Williams, ' To like the poems most needed', <hi rend="i">Overland</hi>, no. 142, <date value="1996">1996</date>, pp. 39-40.</p></note> When reviewing the book, Michael Sharkey summed up the various facets, diversity and contradictions of Barrett Reid's life:
<quote><p>He was a superb public servant and artistic mentor; and a writer of such exemplary cunning verse that it will require an extraordinary biographer to catch all the paradoxical nuances of a life filled with compatible and contrary loves and talents.<note xml:id="fn431-87" n="18"><p><hi rend="sup">18</hi>Michael Sharkey, 'Barrett Reid: poet', <hi rend="i">Australian Book Review</hi>, no. 176, <date value="1995-11">November 1995</date>, pp. 56-57.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>In an extract from the poem 'Go Gently', Reid talked about love, life and death:
<quote><l>I had some joy, I had some pain,</l>
<l>Some sense they may not come again.</l>
<l>Loved much, but too carefully. Do not rage</l>
<l>But love madly to furnish your old age.<note xml:id="fn432-87" n="19"><p><hi rend="sup">19</hi>Barrett Reid, <hi rend="i">Making Country</hi>, Sydney: Angus and Robertson, <date value="1995">1995</date>, p. 65.</p></note></l></quote></p>
<p>In an extract from another poem entitled 'A Kind of Love' dedicated to S. C. (presumably Scott Carter, a close friend of Sweeney Reed) he gave tribute to an unlikely but enduring love affair:
<quote><l>A kind of love</l>
<l>was the best we had.</l>
<l>The time was rarely right</l>
<l>the places often wrong</l>
<l>Friends unknowing</l>
<l>or discreetly shocked.</l>
<l>Too much learning going on.<note xml:id="fn433-87" n="20"><p><hi rend="sup">20</hi>Ibid, p. 68.</p></note></l></quote></p>
<p>In 'Songs of Innocence', Barrett Reid spoke of the tricks and techniques he used and secrets he hid, as he was getting older in order to attract a younger lover:
<quote><l>Dreaming of love for hours</l>
<l>rested and sweet, eyebright,</l>
<pb xml:id="n140" n="140"/>
<l>I wait for the prince and the powers</l>
<l>I need to get fucked tonight.</l>
<l>The garden at eve is romantic</l>
<l>the white doves sleep in the tree</l>
<l>the pink globe is kind. My frantic</l>
<l>dreaming is working wickedly.</l>
<l>Games of myself I'm playing</l>
<l>I've perfected the part. I've paid.</l>
<l>The verses I plan on saying</l>
<l>excuse my tricks to get laid.<note xml:id="fn434-87" n="21"><p><hi rend="sup">21</hi>Ibid, pp. 19-21.</p></note></l></quote></p>
<p><hi rend="i">Making Country</hi> also included 'Miss Porteous Stops the Party', previously published in a few literary magazines. It is a wonderful description of gay life in the <date value="1950">1950s</date> and is based on his old-fashioned landlady when Reid was living for a short time in a bed-sit in Sydney. It shows his astute ability to 'send up' the Aussie accent as the oft-quoted following extract shows:
<quote><l>Writers, actors and artists</l>
<l>Youse call yerselfs,</l>
<l>Actors, artists and writers,</l>
<l>I know youse for what youse are,</l>
<l>prostitutes, pimps and pooftahs</l>
<l>and the police has been called for.</l>
<l>[...]</l>
<l>that while writers, artists and actors</l>
<l>we may be</l>
<l>there was a certain truth</l>
<l>in her accusation.<note xml:id="fn435-87" n="22"><p><hi rend="sup">22</hi>Ibid, pp. 10-11.</p></note></l></quote></p>
<p>Although Reid was a homosexual, he loved the company of women. Philip Jones, Barrett Reid's long-term partner from the mid <date value="1950">1950s</date> until <date value="1984">1984</date>, wrote about their bisexuality, experimentation with sex and their relationships in his memoir, <hi rend="i">Art &amp; Life</hi>:
<quote><p>We were appallingly arrogant &#x2013; ahead of our time in a frank expression of our (bi) sexuality and general mode of life- and we despised suburbia . . .</p>
<p>Marriages and relationships (hetero or homo) were rarely shattered by our liberated stance. The prospect of sexual experimentation was an aphrodisiac, but we tended to be faithful to our partners in our own fashion. One-night stands (mostly on Fridays) were common, and the bounds of gender preferences were frequently crossed.<note xml:id="fn436-87" n="23"><p><hi rend="sup">23</hi>Jones, <hi rend="i">Art &amp; Life</hi>, pp. 73, 80.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>In his memoir Jones is very candid about Reid's love affairs, some named and some unnamed. Names such as Charles Osborne,<note xml:id="fn437-87" n="24"><p><hi rend="sup">24</hi>Charles Osborne, <hi rend="i">Giving it Away</hi>, London: Secker &amp; Warburg, <date value="1986">1986</date>.</p></note> Sidney Nolan,<note xml:id="fn438-87" n="25"><p><hi rend="sup">25</hi>Ramona Koval, 'A last Overland Journey,' <hi rend="i">Age</hi>, <date value="1995-07-24">24 July 1995</date>, p. 13.</p></note> Lesley Stack,<note xml:id="fn439-87" n="26"><p><hi rend="sup">26</hi>Jones, <hi rend="i">Art &amp; Life</hi>, pp. 90-91.</p></note> and

But there were many other sexual encounters and love affairs during Reid's life &#x2013; both men and women.</p>
<p>Reid's most enduring and life-long love, however, was for John and Sunday Reed and their home Heide on the outskirts of Melbourne. This later became a crucible of the Australian modern art movement ats the Heide Museum of Modern Art. Here Reid met and mixed with artists and writers such as Sidney Nolan, Joy Hester, Mirka Mora, Les Kossatz, Charles Blackman, Albert Tucker, John Perceval, Arthur Boyd, and Max Harris. The Reeds played a key role in the development of the modernist art movement in Australia and Barrett Reid became one of their life-long disciples. His relationship with the Reeds and Heide was, 'psychologically charged and defined by his desire to live an almost surrogate life there'.<note xml:id="fn441-87" n="28"><p><hi rend="sup">28</hi>Barrett Reid and Nancy Underhill, eds, <hi rend="i">Letters of John Reed: defining Australian cultural life, <date value="1920">1920</date>-<date value="1981">1981</date></hi>, Ringwood, Vic.: Viking, <date value="2001">2001</date>, p. 435.</p></note></p>
<p>There are conflicting views regarding the nature of the Reed's involvement with their prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9;es. Charles Osborne, former lover of Barrett Reid, expatriate Australian poet, opera critic and man of letters, knew the Reeds in the early days of Heide but took great care never to become fully an inhabitant of their world, which he found both precious and claustrophobic. In his autobiography, <hi rend="i">Giving It Away</hi>, he recalled that period of time:
<quote><p>The official party line was that John and Sunday Reed were virtually angels. They were certainly very generous with their money, their time and their interest, but they seemed to want one's soul in return.<note xml:id="fn442-87" n="29"><p><hi rend="sup">29</hi>Osborne, <hi rend="i">Giving it Away</hi>, p. 41.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>Barrett Reid's second major love was for Sweeney Reed, son of Joy Hester and Albert Tucker. Sweeney was later adopted by John and Sunday Reed. Sweeney was an art gallery owner, a publisher of fine press books and a poet. He was Barrett Reid's godson (this was due to a promise Barrett made to Joy Hester),<note xml:id="fn443-87" n="30"><p><hi rend="sup">30</hi>Barrett Reid, 'I am Hiding in a Rose: a farewell for Sweeney', <date value="1979-03-31"><date review=" -01-31">31 March 1979</date></date>.</p></note> surrogate son and younger brother. Barrett had great love for him and speculated why Sweeney Reed suicided at the age of 34:
<quote><p>Sweeney's whole story was he could never leave Heide, would never really leave Heide to the day he died . . . Heide had an incredible bonding on Sweeney and he was never fully happy anywhere else. He made heroic efforts to establish himself elsewhere, but he always came back, always &#x2013; never ever freed himself of Heide although he tried.<note xml:id="fn444-87" n="31"><p><hi rend="sup">31</hi>Richard Haese, interview with Barrett Reid, <date value="1981-07-03">3 July 1981</date>, <hi rend="c">Pa</hi> 95/161, Box 74, wallet 1, Barrett Reid Papers, <hi rend="c">Ms</hi> <date review="1333">1333</date>9, <hi rend="c">Slv</hi>.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>In his final years, Barrett Reid finally spoke of his third and most enduring love &#x2013; for Shelton Lea the poet. It was in the last few months before his death, when he was highly vulnerable and suffering from the debilitating effects of Hodgkin's disease, that Reid finally wrote about, and acknowledged, this long-standing love. Even though Shelton Lea was heterosexual and Barrett Reid was homosexual, they had total admiration, respect and love for each other. It was a love that developed into a deep bond over 25 years. Diana Georgeff, Shelton Lea's biographer, elaborated on this love when she first met Barrett Reid at Heide:
<quote><p>Throughout that first meeting Barrett was agreeable but he remained composed and proper. Before I left, I asked if there was anything he wanted to add. He said, seemingly out of the blue, 'We [Shelton Lea and I] love each other very much. It's as simple as that'.<note xml:id="fn445-87" n="32"><p><hi rend="sup">32</hi>Diana Georgeff, <hi rend="i">Delinquent Angel</hi>, Sydney: Random House, <date value="2007">2007</date>, p. 191.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<pb xml:id="n142" n="142"/>
<p>In the last letter/poem Barrett Reid wrote at the Austin Hospital several weeks before he died, he described his love for Shelton and tried to put into words their twentyfive year relationship:
<quote><l>Love?</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>But love, because what is already made is not spoken.</l>
<l>We don't want, need to 'make love'.</l>
<l>Love like a carving has been made.</l>
<l>[...]</l>
<l>And yet I like to try and understand this last wonderful mystery</l>
<l>We've made of each other.</l>
<l>You say in so many ways you love me</l>
<l>and I know it because I'm happy,</l>

<head>Catastrophes and changes</head>
<p>Barrett Reid's life changed dramatically in the late <date value="1970">1970s</date> due to a series of catastrophic events that affected both him and Philip Jones, his life-long partner. Jones described the feeling of apprehension and portent in <date value="1978-03">March 1978</date> when he was staying at Horsham and was handed a note to ring John Reed immediately. He rang John and was told that Greenhill in St Andrews (Reid and Jones' home since the <date value="1950">1950s</date>) had burned down the previous day during a bush fire.</p>
<p>Jones recalled the tragic events:
<quote><p>The drive back to Melbourne was horrible. I had lost my home, and I couldn't begin to think what else had gone. Letters, books, records, memorabilia, works of art . . . I thought about Barrie and some terrible intuition informed me that this disaster would portend the end of our relationship. In addition I was filled with a foreboding that the fire was just the beginning of a series of disasters . . . I was right on both counts.<note xml:id="fn447-87" n="34"><p><hi rend="sup">34</hi>Jones, <hi rend="i">Art &amp; Life</hi>, p. 238.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>However, one Nolan landscape painting on loan from John and Sunday Reed had been saved. This, as well as a housing loan and financial assistance from the Reeds of $<date review="2000">2000</date>, paid for a new home to be built at Greenhill, a little further down from their original home.</p>
<p>A few months after their home was destroyed, Reid was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. During that critical time, Reid and and Jones lived in the Aspendale holiday home of John and Sunday Reed whilst their new home was being built. Barrett was still working at the State Library of Victoria. In the same year (<date value="1979">1979</date>), Sweeney Reed suicided and Barrett lost his godson and surrogate son. When John and Sunday Reed died within two weeks of each other in <date value="1981-12">December 1981</date>, Barrett Reid was devastated.</p>
<p>In the space of less than three years he had lost his home and all his personal
<pb xml:id="n143" n="143"/>
possessions (including his books, manuscripts and poems), was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, lost his surrogate son and then his surrogate parents. All these catastrophic events naturally had a major impact on Reid. In <date value="1982">1982</date> he retired after his illustrious career in librarianship due to ill health.</p>
<p>The Will of John and Sunday Reid bequeathed the original homestead at Heide to Barrett Reid and Philip Jones and they were granted full tenure until their death.</p>
<p>However, after a near 30 year relationship Reid split up with Jones in <date value="1984">1984</date> when he indicated that he wanted to 'live on his own' at Heide. Jones reluctantly agreed, even though the homestead at Heide had been inherited by both of them for life. Reid also became Executor and Trustee for both John and Sunday Reed and had control of access to all the papers left in their home. These were eventually housed at the State Library of Victoria after Barrett Reid's death in <date value="1995">1995</date>, but a restriction in his Will ensured they could not be accessed by the public until <date value="2003">2003</date>.</p>
<p>One can speculate on whether Barrett Reid re-invented himself and lived a sort of surrogate life from <date value="1982">1982</date> onwards after his surrogate parents (John and Sunday Reed) and his surrogate son (Sweeney Reed) had died. They were the surrogate family he craved all his life and Heide had become his surrogate home. Diana Georgeff commented on this period of his life:
<quote><p>When Barrett Reid moved into Heide there was some criticism that, to an extent, he took on the role of the Reeds . . . but he relished his place there as a mentor of young poets and artists. Some of his peers now saw his position as counterfeit. Some thought he had become grand, a self-appointed cultural pooh-bah.<note xml:id="fn448-87" n="35"><p><hi rend="sup">35</hi>Georgeff, <hi rend="i">Delinquent Angel</hi>, p. 277.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>Yet Reid was totally rejuvenated:
<quote><p>As for the old farmhouse where I now live among the hundreds of shrub roses and the towering eucalyptus, I think they would be pleased that a literary journal is partly edited here, that young poets and painters crash in the front room and think 'all that stuff was ages ago' and that new paintings are still stacked in the hall.</p>
<p>The other day a young New Zealander made two sculptures near the 'Doll's House' where Sunday stored Nolan's paintings before sending them all to London. Galvanized iron cows. An indigenous material. They are not in the least sacred cows. John and Sunday would have joined in my laughter and enjoyment. Galvanized irony.<note xml:id="fn449-87" n="36"><p><hi rend="sup">36</hi>Barrett Reid, 'Making it New in Australia: some notes on Sunday and John Reed', in <hi rend="i">Angry Penguins and Realist Painting in Melbourne in the <date value="1940">1940s</date></hi>, Hayward Gallery, London, <date value="1988-05-19">19 May</date>-<date value="1988-08-14">14 August 1988</date>, South Bank Centre, <date value="1988">1988</date>, p. 52.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>Barrett Reid's activities in literature and the arts did not end when he retired in <date value="1982">1982</date>. Despite his battle with Hodgkin's disease, there were years of remission. These were his most productive years and they had an inter-connecting theme. They were years where he integrated his love for John and Sunday Reed with his passion for Heide, for the arts, for painting, for editing and for writing. He was finally free to focus on his lifelong passions.</p>
<p>In <date value="1985">1985</date> Reid signed a contract with Penguin books to edit a collection of John Reed's correspondence. This was going to be his final homage to the Reeds. He planned to tell the story of their vision and contribution to the arts and literature. The correspondence would also cover the lives of many artists, writers, friends and family

members who were part of the 'Heide Circle'. This was a massive undertaking that took over 15 years to complete. By <date value="1993">1993</date>, due to the enormity of the project and his health, Nancy Underhill who was Head of the Department of Art History at the University of Queensland became co-editor of the volume. The <hi rend="i">Letters of John Reed: Defining Australian cultural life, <date value="1920">1920</date>-<date value="1981">1981</date></hi> was published in <date value="2001">2001</date>, some six years after Reid's death</p>
<p>While Reid was working on the mammoth task of sorting and editing the letters of John Reed, he was still involved in other projects. In <date value="1987">1987</date> he was the curator for <hi rend="i">A Landscape of a Painter</hi>. This was the Sidney Nolan major retrospective exhibition held in Melbourne at the National Gallery of Victoria, then Sydney, Adelaide and Perth. One year later he wrote the definitive essay entitled 'Making it New in Australia: Some Notes on Sunday and John Reed'. This was part of the detailed catalogue of the exhibition <hi rend="i">Angry Penguins and Realist Painting in Melbourne in the <date value="1940">1940s</date></hi> &#x2013; originally shown at the Hayward Gallery in London in <date value="1988">1988</date>, then throughout Australia.</p>
<p>Then in <date value="1988">1988</date> Reid became editor of <hi rend="i">Overland</hi>, after its founding editor Stephen Murray-Smith died. Barrett Reid had a long-standing involvement with <hi rend="i">Overland</hi> since the late <date value="1950">1950s</date> as Poetry Editor and, from <date value="1965">1965</date>, as Associate Editor. With help from Michael Dugan, Shelton Lea and many others, he edited the literary journal until <date value="1993">1993</date> when he retired due to ill health.</p>
<p>Reid continued integrating his passion for arts and literature when he curated <hi rend="i">Words on Walls: a survey of contemporary visual poetry</hi>, exhibited at Heide in <date value="1989">1989</date> and in <date value="1992">1992</date> he wrote a detailed catalogue, <hi rend="i">Of Dark and Light: the art of John Perceval</hi>, to accompany the exhibition that he (Reid) curated at the National Gallery of Victoria. One of his final public appearances before his death was to launch the opening of <hi rend="i">The Angry Penguins Exhibition</hi> held at the Benalla Art Gallery on <date value="1995-04-16">16 April 1995</date>, where he read from his carefully researched notes.</p>

<p>Nancy Underhill, co-editor with Barrett Reid of the <hi rend="i">Letters of John Reed</hi>, spoke of Reid's passionate involvement with the Reeds and Heide. She stated that she had never been tempted to position herself as a surrogate participant in the Reed's life:
<quote><p>By the time of Barrett's death on <date value="1995-08-06">6 August 1995</date> . . . he seemed assured that he had introduced me to the Reeds and Heide life as he interpreted them . . .</p>

<p>While in <date value="1999">1999</date>, John Barnes in the <hi rend="i">La Trobe Journal</hi> made the following succinct comments regarding Barrett Reid's passionate involvement with Heide:
<quote><p>For him 'Heide' had literally been a meeting place of artists and writers. He had shared in the dismay at the collapse of <hi rend="i">Angry Penguins</hi>, but in his own life he had kept alive its spirit, becoming in his last years a kind of informal historian and

<p>Others were more critical. Barbara Blackman wrote to Judith Wright in <date value="1990">1990</date> about the change she saw in Barrett Reid:
<quote><p>He sits there at Heide 1 [the original home at Heide of John and Sunday Reed] holding court in a kingdom of his own making, making up his people as he goes along, or refusing to remake them where they have remade themselves.

<p>Several months after Reid's death in <date value="1995">1995</date>, Philip Jones commented on how much Reid had changed:
<quote><p>It seemed as though he had something of a personality change after John and Sunday Reed died. He started recreating himself. 'Barrie' became 'Barrett', for example, and
<pb xml:id="n146" n="146"/>
something of a rampant ego emerged. He invented a family history for himself ... He deliberately shunned many of his old friends.

<p>And three years after Reid's death, Kathy Hunt, poet and prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9;e, wrote a satirical piece about her visit to Heide. She used expressions such as, 'He was assuming that I had come to worship at the shrine'. She described Heide as 'a site sacred to art mythologists and the more impressionable members of book clubs and writing groups . . . The small Egyptian palace . . . was really a tomb after all, built to the glory of designated deities.

<p>Philip Jones's response to Hunt's satirical article was, 'a mixture of unholy joy and unhappy reflection':
<quote><p>After the deaths of John and Sunday Reed in <date value="1981">1981</date>, Barrie resolved to be their sole representative and to guard their sacred shrine.</p>
<p>Virtually everyone who had known him since he was young was excluded from his life.

<p>Philip Jones, in the obituary he wrote about his long-term partner (which some people called 'frank and affectionate', whilst others called it 'warts and all'), described Barrett Reid's professional career and skills as a consummate politician:
<quote><p>he channelled his energies into administration as head of the public libraries division of the State Library [Library Council of Victoria]. This work consisted of setting up new library systems and maintaining high standards of service. During these years &#x2013; the 60s and 70s &#x2013; he developed as a tough political negotiator, but against his better nature this style reflected a coarsening of his sensibility.<note xml:id="fn458-87" n="45"><p><hi rend="sup">45</hi>Philip Jones, 'Self-imposed silence of an unsure poet', <hi rend="i">Australian</hi>, <date value="1995-08-08">8 August 1995</date>, p. 18.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>Four years later, John Barnes in the <hi rend="i">La Trobe Journal</hi> captured the true essence of Barrett Reid:
<quote><p>Those familiar with the range of his professional activities could be misled into thinking that his literary activities were marginal to his life.

<p>Shelton Lea, Maudie Palmer, founding Director of the Heide Museum of Modern Art, and his carer/housekeeper Beryl Glasson were there when Reid was dying. Diana Georgeff described the scene:
<quote><p>Barrett was determined to die as he had lived. He had a penchant for management and wanted his death to be well organized. He began to orchestrate his last hours. He wanted to die at Heide in John and Sunday's bed. He wanted to hear Shelton reading poetry as he died. He specified Wallace Stevens, and Coleridge's 'Kubla Khan' . . . At his funeral he wanted no reference to God. He chose the music and the poetry that Shelton would read. He chose his poem called 'Nothing'.

<head>Conclusion</head>
<p>Barrett Reid was a highly dedicated man and a visionary in the public library world who was passionate about the arts and cultural issues within society. His death in <date value="1995">1995</date> due to Hodgkin's disease is not the end of his story, because he left behind a major legacy in the arts, in libraries, in literature and the publishing world.</p>
<p>This legacy continues to live on &#x2013; with his comprehensive art collection of 145 works bequeathed to the Heide Museum of Modern Art, the annual scholarships in librarianship, and the annual poetry award. He bequeathed some of his books to Shelton Lea and several of his art pieces to special people in his life, but the remaining

collection of books, papers, correspondence and pictorial materials are now held by the State Library of Victoria, the Heide Museum of Modern Arts Library, and the National Library of Australia.</p>
<p>It is perhaps fitting to give Reid the last word, via his poem 'See You':
<quote><l>See you later. We've gone</l>
<l>down the road a day</l>
<l>to walk to the horizon</l>
<l>and arrive where we may</l>

This has left an imbalanced, inaccurate and even dishonest picture of the country's past, even though it has a very rich and diverse history of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender experiences, which has been predominantly recounted through oral (ie, non-material) history.</p>
<p>Part of this diversity and richness has been documented by the archival and public work of the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives (<hi rend="c">Alga</hi>) since its establishment in <date value="1978">1978</date>. Other organisations, such as the Women's Liberation and Lesbian Feminist Archives in Melbourne, the Pride History Group in Sydney and many other groups and individuals have also been collecting and documenting the material culture of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> people and communities. All, however, face significant challenges in both resources and broader public support and recognition. <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>, for instance, is a self-funded community group reliant upon volunteers. Its efforts to collect and preserve material and to make it accessible to the public has been significantly limited by lack of resources, and proactive research and accumulation has proved challenging. Conversely, major museums and libraries are yet to substantially focus on <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> histories in their collections or adequately recognize and organize relevant material within existing collections. This absence is in desperate need of correcting, but requires a level of effort, commitment and, above all, courage by management that up to now has not, regrettably, always been evident. Australian museums and libraries have the opportunity to be among world leaders in the field. Exceptional examples, such as the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> Material Survey jointly conducted by Museum Victoria, the State Library of Victoria and <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> have proven that with targeted resource provision for research, we can continue to unearth important and exciting documentation.<note xml:id="fn463-87" n="1"><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi>The Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay and Transgender Material Survey was a project conducted in <date value="2005">2005</date> and jointly sponsored and organised by Museum Victoria, the State Library of Victoria, and the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives. Kate Davison was employed for 6 months on a part-time basis to conduct the Survey, and the report of the project was released as an official Museum Victoria document: Kate Davison, <hi rend="i">Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay &amp; Transgender Material Survey: project report</hi>, Melbourne: Museum Victoria, <date value="2006">2006</date>.

<p>This article will begin by reflecting on current international trends and the theoretical grounding of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> material culture before moving on to a localised analysis of the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> Material Survey as a long awaited and yet to be repeated intervention in the Australian context. Through a discussion of past exhibitions, outcomes of the Survey, and current museum and library practices around cultural diversity, not only will the problems of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> historical material be explored, but also the possibilities of how past practice can be changed for the better. Finally, with a series of recommendations, it will
<pb xml:id="n150" n="150"/>
make the case for large scale and ongoing commitment by institutional management to collaboration and community involvement, in order to finally make this important and hitherto 'hidden' aspect of Australia's past known.</p>

<head>Museums as 'agents of social change' &#x2013; the international context</head>
<p>The difficulties of representing a diversity of sexual identities and practices in times past have long been discussed by many historians, but in recent years this discussion has taken on a practical application in international museum, archive and library practices. Although increased attention to sexualities in these areas can be seen as part of a broader trend evident since the late <date value="1990">1990s</date>, real change has been slow in coming. Mark Liddiard observed in <date value="2004">2004</date> that, despite 'the wide variety of museum forms, with their highly diverse collecting and exhibiting policies, the theme of sexuality has long been almost uniformly ignored in museum displays and exhibitions'.<note xml:id="fn464-87" n="2"><p><hi rend="sup">2</hi>Mark Liddiard, 'Changing Histories: museums, sexuality and the future of the past', <hi rend="i">Museum and Society</hi>, vol. 2, no. 1, <date value="2004-03">March 2004</date>, p. 22.</p></note> The process of addressing this absence, however, runs deeper than simply the idea of social inclusion, and has more serious implications for good historical practice in general. According to Frost, the reason why sex and sexuality should be accurately represented is related to honesty, accuracy, relevance and integrity. An exhibition which did not explore the significance of sex and sexuality where this was relevant would contribute to inaccurate and misleading history.<note xml:id="fn465-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi>S. Frost, 'Museums and the Collecting, Displaying and Interpretation of Sex and Sexuality', unpublished <hi rend="c">Ma</hi> thesis, Leicester: University of Leicester, <date value="2001">2001</date>, quoted in Liddiard, 'Changing Histories', p. 42.</p></note></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the valid caution within historiography surrounding notions of 'honesty' and 'accuracy', museums which claim for better or worse to represent histories of place and society as a whole have a corresponding responsibility to reflect the multitude of narratives thrown up under that rubric, and to actively push against old prejudices. In Australia, this challenging and often very political process is not unknown, the consummate example being the debates around the presentation of Aboriginal Australian histories in the Australian National Museum in the <date value="1990">1990s</date> and beyond.<note xml:id="fn466-87" n="4"><p><hi rend="sup">4</hi>For an account of these debates, see Stuart Macintyre and Anna Clark, <hi rend="i">The History Wars</hi>, 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> edition, Carlton North, Vic.: Melbourne University Publishing, <date value="2004">2004</date>, esp. chapter 10, 'Working Through the Museum's Labels', pp. 191-215.</p></note> Few commentators in Australia today would argue that that project of creating a more honest and nuanced national story, even if uncomfortable for some, had been in vain.</p>
<p>Serious reflection by major Australian institutions specifically on the representation of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> identities, experiences, and stories in the public domain is well overdue, but has finally begun to gather pace. Museums, archives and libraries both in Australia and abroad have undergone a gradual shift in attitude around possibilities and responsibilities for wider social inclusion, not only of sexualities but also other hitherto 'hidden' or excluded aspects of human society such as disability.<note xml:id="fn467-87" n="5"><p><hi rend="sup">5</hi>See for example Richard Sandell, 'Social Inclusion, the Museum and the Dynamics of Sectoral Change', <hi rend="i">Museum &amp; Society</hi>, vol. 1, no. 1, <date value="2003">2003</date>, on museum practices in the United Kingdom.</p></note> This has been buoyed by the creation and inclusion of cultural diversity policies in research, collecting and management structures, but the inertia of the museum industry has been challenged primarily by the hard work done by grass roots <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> community groups in pushing for it 'from below'. Smaller, independent or specialized bodies have taken it upon themselves to initiate proactive inclusion policies, driven by a desire to correct the often obvious gaps in the public historical record, and providing an example for their larger, usually state-administered counterparts.</p>
<pb xml:id="n151" n="151"/>
<p>Internationally, the indications and effects of this groundswell can be seen in examples such as Berlin's <hi rend="i">Schwules Museum</hi> (Gay Museum) &#x2013; a combined museum, archive and library surviving on donations &#x2013; which provides consultancy to other museums and organisations. Poland, the Netherlands, the United States, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other countries have either had discussions about establishing museums like the <hi rend="i">Schwules Museum</hi>, or have had exhibitions in major public museums within the last five years. Indicating the growing impact of these efforts, there is now an internationally focused organization dedicated to the development of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> collecting and exhibitions. The Archives, Libraries, Museums and Special Collections (<hi rend="c">Alms</hi>) inaugural conference was held at the University of Minnesota in <date value="2006">2006</date>, the second in <date value="2008">2008</date> and the third conference is scheduled for <date value="2011">2011</date>. Several organisations have also made changes to their acquisition practices, particularly in the <hi rend="c">Uk</hi>. Since <date value="2006">2006</date>-<date value="2007">2007</date> the Museum of London has begun to include <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> perspectives in its official collecting policies, and according to the Library of Norwich (<hi rend="c">Uk</hi>) website, 'local gay and lesbian community representatives advise on the selection and display of stock'.<note xml:id="fn468-87" n="6"><p><hi rend="sup">6</hi>Museums, Libraries &amp; Archives (<hi rend="c">Uk</hi>), <date value="2009">2009</date>, 'Marketing Approaches in Norfolk Libraries', <ptr target="http://www.mla.gov.uk/what/raising_standards/best_practice/Community%20Engagement/Norwich_ marketing"/> (accessed <date value="2010-07-08">8 July 2010</date>).</p></note> Here in Australia, the State Library of New South Wales has long had a special collection devoted to gathering material related to the gay liberation movement. These examples can be matched by many others from around the world.</p>
<p>Most importantly there are indications that major institutions are not simply bowing passively to pressure, but are beginning to recognise their powerful social role and their duty to proactively challenge prejudices and omissions. Evidence of this is reflected in books such as Richard Sandell's <hi rend="i">Museums, Prejudice and the Reframing of Difference</hi>, published in <date value="2007">2007</date>. As Sandell points out:
<quote><p>museums have become increasingly confident in proclaiming their value as agents of social change and, in particular, articulating their capacity to promote crosscultural understanding, to tackle prejudice and intolerance and to foster respect for difference.<note xml:id="fn469-87" n="7"><p><hi rend="sup">7</hi>Richard Sandell, <hi rend="i">Museums, Prejudice and the Reframing of Difference</hi>, Oxford: Routledge, <date value="2007">2007</date>, p. 2.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>Against this international backdrop, the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> Material Survey in Victoria in <date value="2005">2005</date>-<date value="2006">2006</date> (hereafter referred to as 'the Survey') was the first major, concentrated attempt by an Australian museum to confront the non-appearance of the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> community in its collections and displays. In <date value="2003">2003</date>, coinciding with moves by Museum Victoria to address issues of cultural diversity in relation to sexuality, the museum was approached by members of the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> communities with an exhibition proposal to mark the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> anniversary of the <hi rend="i">Crimes (Sexual Offences) Act <date value="1980">1980</date></hi>, which decriminalised some sexual acts between men in the state of Victoria. While many broad, long-term aims were discussed, the concrete outcome was to conduct a limited pilot project to firstly tackle the issue of material documentation, and later to investigate future possibilities in the state of Victoria. This was jointly organised and directed by <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>, Museum Victoria and the State Library of Victoria and modestly funded by Museum Victoria and the State Library. In <date value="2006">2006</date> the report of the project was published, with a range of recommendations for future work, including the need for such research to extend beyond the state of Victoria.</p>

<head>History on the fringes &#x2013; the national and historical context of the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> Material Survey</head>
<p>As a pilot project the Survey was a crucial, if tentative, intervention in the struggle to bring <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> history out of the shadows of arbitrary will and asserting its due place in the national story. The Survey report was the first major document to be published on the subject by an Australian museum. Nationally, the only available example of previous work done in compiling a similar listing of material at the time of the Survey was a page on the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales' website detailing a contentsoverview of 'Gay and Lesbian Life and Culture'. That pioneering list, which contains examples from across the library's collections, was the result of a wider internal project that identified thirty-five priority areas within the library's collection in need of resources and promotion.<note xml:id="fn470-87" n="8"><p><hi rend="sup">8</hi>Of the 35 areas, others included 'Transportation', 'Australian Children's Literature', 'Family History' and 'Agrictulture'.

<p>The <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> website provides a list of archival resources from both within and outside Australia. However the Australian list is limited to five material repositories: the State Library of New South Wales listing and the <hi rend="c">Sa</hi> Memory website mentioned above, the <hi rend="c">Aids</hi> Action Council of the <hi rend="c">Act</hi> library, the Victorian Women's Liberation and Lesbian Feminist Archive in Melbourne and the Willis Collection of gay and lesbian books at the University of Melbourne, along with two electronic collections: Writings from the Australian Gay Left and a BlackWattle Press Publications list.<note xml:id="fn473-87" n="11"><p><hi rend="sup">11</hi>Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, <ptr target="mailto:http://home.vicnet.net.au/~alga/links.htm"/> (accessed <date value="2010-07-08">8 July 2010</date>).</p></note> There are also other non-listed repositories across the country such as the Gay and Lesbian Archive of Western Australia, the Lespar Feminist Library Catalogue (<hi rend="c">Wa</hi>), the <hi rend="c">Eros</hi> Foundation Publications and Archives, to name a few. This overview reveals the importance of building on work already begun by <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>.</p>
<p>Similarly, although many excellent, provocative and celebratory exhibitions have been held over the last three decades, they have all been temporary and have occurred at the behest of small collectives, independent museums or local councils. Between <date value="1982">1982</date> and <date value="2010">2010</date> over 25 exhibitions representing queer histories were held around Australia, including at least six in Victoria. Of those held in Victoria, four were communityorganised and curated, and two others were components of thematic exhibitions at the Australian Jewish Museum. Nationally, many of these exhibitions have drawn out different experiences and challenges that illuminate further how major museums could take a more proactive role. Brief consideration of three examples can illuminate.</p>

<head>1. <hi rend="i">The Gay Museum Exhibition</hi> (<date value="2003">2003</date>), Western Australian Museum, Perth</head>
<p>The objects included in this exhibition were chosen for their ability to provide a 'queer reading' rather than a direct, proven linkage to actual queer experiences or people.<note xml:id="fn474-87" n="12"><p><hi rend="sup">12</hi>Jo Darbyshire, 'Gay Museum Catalogue', Perth <date value="2003">2003</date>, <ptr target="http://www.jodarbyshire.com/files/gay_ museum_catalogue.pdf"/> (accessed <date value="2010-07-08">8 July 2010</date>).</p></note> One example is a die carved from bone recovered from the <hi rend="i">Zeewijk</hi> shipwreck (<date value="1727">1727</date>) off the

Western Australian coast. Two of the survivors &#x2013; boys &#x2013; were later found having sex and were consequently marooned on coral islands. The die cannot be proven to have had a direct relation to either of the boys, nor does the object itself tell a story about sexuality, yet it provided an opportunity for the story to be told through its visual tangibility &#x2013; this approach could be adopted by major museums.</p>

<p>These two exhibitions contained clear and identified components devoted to incorporating the experience of gay and lesbian people within the Jewish community. Both faced significant challenges. The first was regarded controversial enough for some school groups to boycott the museum due to the inclusion of lesbian and gay experiences, while the second was met with criticism by the Jewish <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> community as failing to properly acknowledge the diversity of sexual experience due to its focus on a limited perspective of gay male sexuality. Nevertheless, the Director says the Museum is committed to continuing to build upon <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> representation, highlighting the importance of proactive policy.<note xml:id="fn475-87" n="13"><p><hi rend="sup">13</hi>Telephone conversation with Helen Light, Director, Australian Jewish Museum, <date value="2005-05">May 2005</date>.</p></note></p>

<p>Presented under the auspices of the <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> and funded by Visions Australia, a Federal Government Touring Program, 'Forbidden Love' was a travelling exhibition curated by a small community collective, History Inverted, and was built around the narratives of nine women's lives. It was displayed at the State Library of Victoria, as well as at other capital cities and regional centres. The material for the exhibition was collected both from the subjects of the exhibition themselves and other sources. Without government funding it would not have taken place, revealing the importance of financial resources, but it also shows the advantages of community direction.</p>
<p>Poor documentation and knowledge of material objects associated with minority, hidden, or excluded histories have limited the possibility of large-scale exhibitions. The primary contribution of the Survey was to dispense with the myth that the material cannot be found and to highlight the need for a more permanent commitment of resources. Although <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> has gathered a substantial and impressive collection, it is poorly resourced, and records of community organisations, personal papers and artefacts are largely still held only in private collections.</p>
<p>As such, the Survey research was made up of two major components: investigations into the holdings of public institutions and repositories, and a search for as yet undocumented personal and community collections. Concretely, the work of the project not only involved conducting database searches of publicly accessible collecting institutions, but also reached out to the community by distributing the survey flyer as widely as possible, announcements at public events such as the <date value="2005">2005</date> Midsumma Festival, and the <hi rend="i">Camp As . . . Melbourne in the <date value="1950">1950s</date></hi> exhibition put on by the Melbourne City Council, and radio and newspaper spots. We contacted the vast memberships of many
<pb xml:id="n155" n="155"/>
historical or <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> organizations, such as the <hi rend="c">Also</hi> Foundation and the Matrix Guild of Victoria, calling on people with relevant information to contact us. An article was published in Museum Victoria's magazine, and we achieved successful coverage in the Melbourne <hi rend="i">Age</hi> with a quarter-page article, when we put the journalist in contact with some 'real people' who had personal collections, one of whom was in possession of material dating back to the <date value="1950">1950s</date>.<note xml:id="fn476-87" n="14"><p><hi rend="sup">14</hi>Farah Farouque, 'Gathering Clues to Melbourne's Secret Gay Past', <hi rend="i">Age</hi>, <date value="2005-04-15">15 April 2005</date>.</p></note> The major realisation in all of this, particularly with our database searches, was the <hi rend="i">slipperiness</hi> in defining what we were looking for, which led to another major component of the Survey &#x2013; establishing our methodology.</p>

<head>What, where, who and how? Developing a research methodology for museums and libraries</head>
<p>Sexuality and sexual identity is in a constant state of movement and change &#x2013; the sexual and gender identity categories we are familiar with today may or may not have been conceptualised in the same way in the past. In <date value="1992">1992</date> Garry Wotherspoon observed that in order to unearth lesbian, gay and queer histories in Australia, research requires 'a framework that allows one to look at the history of something which, at that point, did not exist'. He observed the ongoing methodological problems of finding historical material that went beyond legal records &#x2013; police, court and prison &#x2013; that tend toward condemnatory portrayals. At that time he came up with newspapers, biographies, letters, and oral histories.<note xml:id="fn477-87" n="15"><p><hi rend="sup">15</hi>Garry Wotherspoon, 'From Private Vice to Public History: Homosexuality in Australia', <hi rend="i">Public History Review</hi>, vol. 1, <date value="1992">1992</date>, p. 150.</p></note> However, our work needs to be focused on finding <hi rend="i">repositories</hi> of material, both public and private, and not simply isolated historical objects or documents. As revealed in the example of the Gay Museum exhibition in Western Australia, often material with less-obvious associations &#x2013; a bone die &#x2013; can provide more evocative insights into experiences of the past.</p>
<p>At the time of the Survey, there were no research models in Australia to follow. During the course of our work, we became aware of <hi rend="i">Buried in the Footnotes</hi>, a project on the representation of experiences of disability within museums across the United Kingdom, the aims of which, due to parallels with <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> history, echoed ours<hi rend="i"></hi>.<note xml:id="fn478-87" n="16"><p><hi rend="sup">16</hi>Jocelyn Dodd, Richard Sandell, Annie Delin and Jackie Gay, 'Beggars, Freaks and Heroes?

That project was followed up by a more extensive undertaking, from <date value="2006">2006</date>-<date value="2009">2009</date>. Jocelyn Dodd, Richard Sandell, Debbie Jolly and Ceri Jones, eds, <hi rend="i">Rethinking Disability Representation in Museums and Galleries</hi>, Leicester: Research Centre for Museums and Galleries, University of Leicester, <date value="2008-12">December 2008</date>.</p></note> Their research team distributed a detailed questionnaire to 224 curators of museums and collections to ascertain the levels of awareness among curators, the details of relevant material and attitudes towards its collection, documentation and interpretation. Of those returned, a shortlist of 10 museums was selected for site visits of one to two days each, where catalogues and databases were searched extensively. That pilot project has since been followed up by a more extensive undertaking, a &#x00A3;5 million project involving nine museums across the <hi rend="c">Uk</hi> working with a think-tank of activists, artists and cultural practitioners. Another example was a project to create a 'virtual museum' of lesbian and gay history containing information about material from across the <hi rend="c">Uk</hi>. Curators, librarians and archivists were asked to scour their collections in search of documents and items relating to the lives of gay people, with a view to establishing a user-friendly online information source. Backed by the British museums' documentation watchdog, <hi rend="c">Mda</hi>, the group Proud Heritage sent out a two-page questionnaire requesting that
<pb xml:id="n156" n="156"/>
institutions throughout the country list the gay and lesbian documents and artefacts in their collections.<note xml:id="fn479-87" n="17"><p><hi rend="sup">17</hi>Mark Honigsbaum, 'Search for Gay History to Create Virtual Museum', <hi rend="i">Guardian</hi>, <date value="2005-12-12"><date review=" -12-12">12 December 2005</date></date>.</p></note> Such frameworks require significant investment of human resources and it is important to note that their research began from the assumption that <hi rend="i">there would be evidence to be found</hi>.</p>
<p>The practical approach of the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> Material Survey was guided by the need to 'cast a wide net'. Our methods were not confined to an internal museum questionnaire but encompassed a broad range of publicity methods to promote awareness of and engagement with the project. However, given the 'pilot' status of this project, it was necessary to delineate the boundaries of what was relevant and of interest to the aims of the project, and also to distinguish between types of material. Many of the collections found were archival in nature rather than object-based. These were all accepted as being of research relevance, though the potential for exhibitions based extensively on paper documents is limited. Similarly, often collections and objects were included for their <hi rend="i">associations</hi> with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender histories, rather than a direct connection. The Barry Humphreys Collection at the Performing Arts Museum is a good example &#x2013; while Humphreys does not identify as gay, his characters and performance have played a crucial role in popular Australian conceptions of gender and sexuality, and have a level of symbolic importance and connection to certain sections of the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> community. Similarly, the Percy Grainger Museum collection contains material associated with Grainger's sexual practices involving sado-masochism and, while there is no explicit evidence that he himself engaged in same-sex acts, the items were included on the basis of its relevance to non-heteronormative sexuality. Further communication with the curator confirmed that Grainger had homosexual and bisexual friends, correspondence with whom appears in the collection.</p>
<p>Developing a research model was therefore the central task of the Consultative Committee established to oversee the Material Survey, which incorporated representatives from the project's partner institutions, local government and key community groups as well as individuals with particular knowledge and experience, encompassing the spectrum of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender sexualities. We resolved that a multi-tiered research classification system would be an effective way to overcome problems in deciding what sorts of material to prioritise with the available resources using the following classifications as a starting point:<note xml:id="fn480-87" n="18"><p><hi rend="sup">18</hi>Acknowledgement for the original concept upon which this model was based must go to Consultative Committee member Colin Batrouney, Victorian <hi rend="c">Aids</hi> Council.</p></note></p>
<p><hi rend="i">orientation</hi> &#x2013; direct relevance, (eg. identified individuals, material containing the words lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or other historically specific terminology such as camp);</p>
<p><hi rend="i">association</hi> &#x2013; icons or public figures, individuals associated with lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender communities;</p>
<p><hi rend="i">sensibility</hi> &#x2013; symbolism, potential for subtext and <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> readings, (eg. the die in the Western Australia Gay Museum).</p>

framework that can also be used on a national scale.<note xml:id="fn481-87" n="19"><p><hi rend="sup">19</hi>It is worth noting that the Museum of London has been undergoing a similar process of developing a collections framework, and has established an advisory group dedicated to this purpose. Museum of London, Raminder Kaur, <date value="2005-06">June 2005</date>, <ptr target="http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/RWWC/Essays/Essay1/"/> (accessed <date value="2010-07-14">14 July 2010</date>).</p></note></p>
<p>Taking this multi-tiered framework, our catalogue and database searches used a variety of keywords; however, it was evident that successful searching often rested upon one 'knowing what you're looking for before you start looking'. This was particularly true in the case of the state and national libraries' manuscripts collections, the ScreenSound Australia database, the National Archives of Australia and Public Records Office of Victoria, where names and biographical information are usually required.</p>
<p>For Museum Victoria and the State Library of Victoria, like the <hi rend="i">Buried in the Footnotes</hi> project described above, electronic searches of the database were followed up with manual surveys of objects in on-site storage. Descriptions of objects in the electronic database are often limited, and the relevance of objects to the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities may not be identified in the electronic record. Standardised subject headings both within individual museums and across the museum sector (perhaps under the auspices of Museums Australia) would be of particular value and a national, publicly accessible, online list of materials and documents of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> relevance (in the manner of the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales) would be a major advance.</p>

<head>Concrete outcomes of the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> Material Survey</head>
<p>The direct outcomes of the Survey have not been meagre. At the beginning of the survey Museum Victoria's collection database listed only nine objects with 'lesbian and gay' subject relevance. There are now over 148 objects, and more than 80 additional objects with broader relevance to sexuality and feminism. Most of the new additions arose from our manual trawling<note xml:id="fn482-87" n="20"><p><hi rend="sup">20</hi>The careful and methodical work of Museum Victoria volunteer Chris Friday must be acknowledged here.</p></note> of the <hi rend="i">already existing</hi> History and Technology Collections Store at the Melbourne Museum, although there were some new acquisitions, including a handsome silver teapot awarded in <date value="1857">1857</date> to the 'lady squatter' Caroline Newcomb, surviving lifepartner of pioneer farmer Anne Drysdale, by the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of Geelong and the Western District.<note xml:id="fn483-87" n="21"><p><hi rend="sup">21</hi><ptr target="mailto:http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/1111270/teapot-silver-trophy-missnewcomb-1857"/> (accessed <date value="2010-11-10"><date review=" -10-10">10 November 2010</date></date>). The diary of Anne Drysdale is held at the State Library of Victoria: <hi rend="c">Ms</hi> 6294, <hi rend="c">Ms</hi> 6208 and H15215. The teapot and its significance is discussed in Bev Roberts' article &#x2013; 'Miss Newcomb's Teapot' &#x2013; in this issue.</p></note> By late <date value="2010">2010</date>, a third of Museum Victoria's <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> collection has been loaded onto the museum's website, and further information is available through the Culture Victoria website. Almost the entire collection has been image-captured, and narratives about the project and the gay liberation movement are now available online.<note xml:id="fn484-87" n="22"><p><hi rend="sup">22</hi><ptr target="mailto:http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/themes/2730/lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-project-museum-victoria-2005-2006"/> and <ptr target="mailto:http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/themes/2832/gay-liberation-movement"/> (accessed <date value="2010-11-10"><date review=" -10-10">10 November 2010</date></date>).</p></note> The State Library of Victoria is also considering the development of a bibliography on the Library's website, following the model of the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales' 'Gay and lesbian life and culture' web page.</p>
<p>Another direct outcome was more tangible in terms of changing public consciousness. One of the key permanent exhibitions at Museum Victoria is the <hi rend="i">Melbourne Story</hi>, a vast and engaging display of the social history of the city. An addition was made in the form of a video interview with Mac Ronan and Geoff Allingham, a gay couple who had been living in the suburbs for several decades. The interview was inserted into a collection of short videos about experiences of life in the suburbs, thereby demystifying the existence of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> people in the everyday life of the city.</p>
<pb xml:id="n158" n="158"/>
<p>Yet many striking absences remain in the collections. In particular there is a dearth of material pre-dating the <date value="1970">1970s</date> on transgender, bisexual and lesbian histories, and on regional Victoria. It is also worth noting that the <hi rend="i">silences</hi> (as opposed to absences) in the material record were overwhelmingly found in nineteenth and early twentieth-century holdings in the larger collecting institutions. The major silence, however, is the overall lack of representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender histories in existing exhibitions &#x2013; in stories of immigration, in the life of Melbourne, within Indigenous Australian histories, and in relation to scientific, biological and technological areas. Sadly, and to the frustration of many both within and outside the Museum and Library, the video interview in the <hi rend="i">Melbourne Story</hi> remains the sole advance on that front. At the time the survey was being conducted, for example, the scientific Mind &amp; Body Gallery exhibition at the Melbourne Museum told a hetero-normative, reproductionfocused story of sexuality. This points to the pressing need for the application of cultural diversity policies across all museum and library departments, but perhaps even more pressing need for those policies to be updated and overhauled to reflect the realities of contemporary society.</p>
</div>
<div xml:id="t1-g-t13-body-d6">
<head>Diversity within 'Cultural Diversity' policies</head>
<p>It is undeniable that there are recognisable cultural groupings around sexual identities and practices both in the present and in Victoria's past, yet until recently, practical applications of 'cultural diversity' have overwhelmingly excluded sexuality and gender. Deborah Tout-Smith, Curator for Cultural Diversity at Museum Victoria, noted in <date value="2004">2004</date> that 'cultural diversity collections in major institutions in Australia still focus on ethnicity, race and nationality rather than the broader meanings of cultural diversity'.<note xml:id="fn485-87" n="23"><p><hi rend="sup">23</hi>Deb Tout-Smith (on behalf of Cr Julian Hill, City of Port Phillip), <hi rend="i">'</hi>The Gay Museum Exhibition Brief', unpublished proposal, <date value="2004-10">October 2004</date>. On file at Museum Victoria, History &amp; Technology Department.</p></note></p>
<p>Definitions of the term, including those in Equal Opportunity statements, have remained vague and generalised, leaving ample room for interpretation of how 'cultural groupings' might be understood, although this is now undergoing significant change. The <hi rend="i">Equal Opportunity Act</hi> now clearly includes the categories of gender identity, lawful sexual activity, sex, and sexual orientation in the grounds for equality of opportunity.<note xml:id="fn486-87" n="24"><p><hi rend="sup">24</hi><hi rend="i">Equal Opportunity Act <date value="1995">1995</date></hi>, incorporating amendments as at <date value="2003-04-03">3 April 2003</date>, Melbourne: Anstat, <date value="2003">2003</date>, pp. 14-15.</p></note> Within the museums and archival field, the Gay and Lesbian Policy Guidelines (<date value="1999">1999</date>) of the umbrella organisation Museums Australia state:
<quote><p>[s]exuality, along with many other factors, is an element of cultural diversity. The mission statements written into museum charters which guarantee the representation of cultural diversity in the collections, education programs and displays of the museum cannot be met successfully until lesbian and gay cultures and histories are included and integrated.<note xml:id="fn487-87" n="25"><p><hi rend="sup">25</hi><hi rend="i">Gay and Lesbian Policy Guidelines For Museum Programs and Practice</hi>, Parkes, <hi rend="c">Act</hi>: Museums Australia Incorporated, <date value="1999">1999</date>.</p></note></p></quote></p>
<p>It has nevertheless taken much longer for these advances in policy to be reflected in practice.</p>
<p>The History and Technology Collection at Museum Victoria has, since the late <date value="1980">1980s</date>, been actively collecting material relating to cultural diversity. However, up until the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> Material Survey this material had almost entirely been collected in the context of
<pb xml:id="n159" n="159"/>
immigration and multiculturalism. In <date value="2004">2004</date> a new Collection Development Plan (Cultural Diversity) provided the first inclusive definition of cultural diversity listing sexuality as an important feature. The stated aims of the new plan included serious consideration of cultural diversity across collection areas, support for the collection of material that would balance the material record of Victorian history. It identified that 'virtually no material has been collected' in sexuality and gender and, furthermore, recognised 'that much collecting in this area needs to be proactive to ensure the experiences of minorities or minority experiences are properly documented in the collection'.<note xml:id="fn488-87" n="26"><p><hi rend="sup">26</hi><hi rend="i">Collection Development Plan &#x2013; Cultural Diversity</hi>, Melbourne: Museum Victoria, <date value="2004-10">October 2004</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>The State Library of Victoria's Collection Development Policy states that the library will, among other things, 'enrich the cultural, educational, social and economic life of <hi rend="i">all Victorians</hi> by collecting, preserving and making available their documentary and published heritage'.<note xml:id="fn489-87" n="27"><p><hi rend="sup">27</hi><hi rend="i">Collection Development Policy</hi>, Melbourne: State Library of Victoria, <date value="2001">2001</date>. Italics added.</p></note> A definition of what constitutes the 'cultural, educational, social and economic life' of Victorians is unfortunately not provided, leaving room for normative (ie. <hi rend="i">hetero</hi>normative) interpretations. Collections of material other than published books are categorised by medium (eg. manuscripts or photographs) rather than social or technological association. Items within the overall State Library collection are catalogued using a selection of Library of Congress subject headings, selection being dependent on a range of social and administrative circumstances.<note xml:id="fn490-87" n="28"><p><hi rend="sup">28</hi>See, for example, Library of Congress Subclass <hi rend="c">Hq</hi> 'The family. Marriage. Women' which contains the sub-categories: Sexuality, Bisexuality, Homosexuality, Transvestitism, Transsexualism, Erotica, Free Love, and Lifestyle, all of which could prove to be relevant. Library of Congress, 'Library of Congress Classification Outline, Class H, Social Sciences'. <ptr target="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/lcco_h.pdf"/> (accessed <date value="2010-07-08">8 July 2010</date>).</p></note> In turn, the application of these subject headings to the material being catalogued can be dependent on the knowledge and personal biases of the catalogue staff. As a result, searches of State Library subject catalogues can return meagre results, and there are significant gaps and silences where the <hi rend="i">actual</hi> identification of the experience of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> sexuality is concerned, whereas there are in fact several collections that contain potentially relevant material.</p>
<p>It may be suggested that large institutions have at times been hesitant to acquire material explicitly relevant to specific groups and subcultures through desire not to 'step on the toes' of smaller, community-based collecting bodies. Where <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> histories are concerned, <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> is an obvious example. While a welcome acknowledgement of the important work of these groups, it cannot be assumed that smaller organisations have the adequate resources, nor indeed that the reasons behind the low level of acquisitions in the area are due to such understanding! Similarly, it is not simply acquisitions and collecting policies and practices that produce gaps in the representation of the heritage of <hi rend="i">'all Victorians'</hi>. A primary reason for the establishment of the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> Material Survey was the absence of <hi rend="i">identified</hi> material relating to sexuality within these large institutions. As the Survey was able to show, relevant material can be found in existing collections with appropriate resourcing.</p>
<p>It is also unfortunately still the case that an inclusive understanding and application of cultural diversity is yet to arrive in some quarters. Overall the experience of staff and volunteers on the project was positive, and we were met with openness and support by a majority of historical organisations, researchers, support teams and individuals with whom we came in contact during the six-month timeframe. Regrettably, homophobic attitudes occasionally imposed limitations on our work. This confirms how vital it is
<pb xml:id="n160" n="160"/>
that such initiatives have the weight of public organisations behind them, thus providing momentum against old prejudice. Staff at one organisation with a large membership of older Victorians, for example, when approached about distributing the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> Material Survey flyer, responded that it would not be 'appropriate' to distribute information 'like that' to their clientele. This was a blow to the work of the survey, as the older generation was one of our target audiences. Fortunately responses like this were incredibly rare, though it would be beneficial for future research to establish a set of guidelines on how to respond to varying attitudes to sexuality, and how to communicate the aims of the survey to effectively counter-balance notions that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender histories are controversial.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen, and what forms the central challenge posed by this article, is whether large collecting and exhibiting institutions around Australia can broaden and deepen their practices around cultural diversity, to address the issues of honesty, accuracy, relevance and integrity highlighted earlier. What is really needed is a creative and multifaceted approach, backed up by a strong infrastructure and concretely, a permanent and matter-of-fact commitment by museum management at all levels. Most importantly, it is crucial that the development of the field is characterised by a collaborative framework and community involvement at every step of the way.</p>
</div>
<div xml:id="t1-g-t13-body-d7">
<head>Future directions: commitment, collaboration and community</head>
<p>Future work in the field of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> histories in material culture must occur on three broad fronts. These are: a) research, acquisition and collection development; b) space, storage and resources; and c) exhibitions.</p>
<p>In the first of these areas the most pressing issues are the provision of funding and infrastructure for research into the development of existing collections, a review and overhaul of cultural diversity policies, and catalogue keyword development (ideally with national synchronisation). Discussions have taken place with a view to expanding the pilot survey model into a national project, with possible joint-funding through the large institutions and an Australian Research Council Linkage Grant. Regrettably, these discussions are yet to bear fruit, due primarily to a lack of confidence in securing institutional funding, and also a lack of clarity about what the primary goal of the project would be.</p>
<p>The second area concerning space, storage and resources has been an ongoing issue faced by the community-based organisations that have dedicated many years to collecting material at a grass-roots level. The Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives holds the most significant collection of material relating to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history in Australia, but has been plagued by issues of storage space and appropriate storage conditions. <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> has recently moved to more suitable premises, having for many years gallantly occupied the basement of the Victorian <hi rend="c">Aids</hi> Council. However, serious discussions about the longevity/permanence of its location continue. Furthermore, the question of both human and financial resources in terms of cataloguing,
<pb xml:id="n161" n="161"/>
sorting, provenance, acquisition, handling and access continues to loom large.</p>
<p>The idea has been raised for the State Library of Victoria to 'adopt' the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives under a collaborative agreement, thereby solving many of the practical problems listed above. Such a proposal throws up serious and complex problems about community access and control, which warrant careful and sober consideration. Despite resourcing problems, one of the things that has kept <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> so strong is its almost symbiotic relationship with the grass-roots <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> community whose history it has aimed to preserve &#x2013; volunteers have a hands-on interaction with the collection, and scholars, students, researchers and other interested parties can access the collection at any time (by appointment) with a delegated committee member. The biggest problem here is how to balance institutional support and preservation of the material with the maintenance of a dynamic, community directed archive.</p>
<p>The are other cases that highlight the complex issues involved. The Victorian Women's Liberation and Lesbian Feminist Archive, for example, has an agreement with the Melbourne University Archives where control and ownership of the collection remains with the Archive Committee, but they receive support in the form of housing and appropriate storage. The collection is searchable on the University Archives' database and can be accessed through the normal university channels. However, to a large extent this has resulted in the collection being removed from the lesbian and feminist communities, and its location in a university archive may serve as an obstacle for some. Similar issues can be seen with the Lesbian and Gay Archives of New Zealand(<hi rend="c">Laganz</hi>), which is housed within the main collection of the National Library and Archives New Zealand in Wellington (following a firebomb attack on the original location). <hi rend="c">Laganz</hi> receives not only storage and other material support, but also curatorial support from National Library and Archive staff. But rather than the material remaining under community control, <hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Laganz</hi></hi> members and volunteers are now subject to strict access restrictions as dictated by these larger organisations. The manuscript collection can only be accessed by arrangement with one of two appointed curators, while the collection of published materials is, according to the website, 'mostly not available'.<note xml:id="fn491-87" n="29"><p><hi rend="sup">29</hi><ptr target="http://www.laganz.org.nz/collections/html"/> Last updated: <date value="2010-10-26">26 October 2010</date>.</p></note></p>
<p>Through the <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> Material Survey, we began to tackle these issues by drafting a Partnership Agreement between the three participating organisations &#x2013; an important symbolic step in establishing a firm structure for ongoing collaboration between the institutions and the community. We moved from locating and documenting other collections of relevant material, to exploring how Museum Victoria and the State Library of Victoria could structurally and materially support the <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>. As the Survey was a pilot project, the Partnership Agreement was cautious about committing to practical aspects of storage and access, and focused rather on establishing cooperative structures for expanding our initial research. Crucially, the process of developing the Partnership Agreement demonstrated the importance of a formal, official, and publicly recognised commitment by large organisations to resourcing and initiating such research projects in a collaborative framework, as research into lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, can &#x2013;
<pb xml:id="n162" n="162"/>
as we know &#x2013; fall prey to normative interpretations of cultural diversity. In a similar vein, it can fall down the list of priorities without an enthusiastic and personally committed curator or staff member. This has been the case at the Mitchell Library where the Lesbian and Gay Life and Culture collection has not significantly expanded since the departure of a particularly active staff member. A more solidified management-level commitment could guard against the turnover of individual curators and staff. It would be a fantastic step to see the already enacted Partnership Agreement continue to build on the work already done, by pushing for the expansion of the Survey project on a national scale.</p>
<p>The third area for future work is in the field of exhibitions. Public displays of museum and library material are well known for their educational and social value in raising popular awareness about our past &#x2013; often a museum display is the only conscious interaction some people have with the history of their own society. A significant recommendation of the Survey report was the idea of mounting a large museum-quality exhibition of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender histories from Victoria and from around Australia. As the project brief was being developed, it was envisaged that the outcomes would bring us closer to a professionally-developed historical exhibition to be hosted by a major collecting institution, and which could incorporate collaboration with partner-museums and libraries in other states and territories. Such an exhibition would be a highly effective way of raising awareness of the need for these histories to continue to be unearthed and documented, and would therefore contribute to the primary aim of this project &#x2013; to build into the Victorian and Australian stories the important role that <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> sexuality, sexual experience and identity has played not only in individuals lives but also in broader society. A related issue is the pressure of time with regard to private collections and community knowledge. Many older, pre-<date value="1970">1970s</date> records are disappearing as their owners and collectors age and pass away. Resources are needed to ensure that their memories and experiences do not simply drift into the unknown. As yet, no progress has been made on the development of a dedicated exhibition in the major museums, and with lead-in times averaging between three and five years, we will be waiting a while longer. Yet the example of the <hi rend="i">Melbourne Story</hi> oral video narrative is an encouraging, albeit small, sign of how museums can and should now begin to act.</p>
</div>
<div xml:id="t1-g-t13-body-d8">
<head>Conclusion</head>
<p>As indicated in the introduction, one area of <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> historical practice in Australia that has always been strong is oral history. Oral histories have formed a crucial cache of information, more often than not spurring the collection of related material culture. The centrality of oral narratives can be seen in the <hi rend="i"><hi rend="c">Camp</hi> Stonewall</hi> public installation in Sydney's Taylor Square, opened in <date value="2010-09">September 2010</date> to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Campaign Against Moral Persecution movement. This temporary public art monument is an interactive <hi rend="i">stone wall</hi> of oral history recordings which can be heard via speakers in the wall. Artist Annie Kennedy said these stories 'have been an invaluable contribution to completing this historical narrative that gives a glimpse of
<pb xml:id="n163" n="163"/>
what it means to be gay in Australia'.<note xml:id="fn492-87" n="30"><p><hi rend="sup">30</hi><ptr target="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/Development/CityImprovements/PublicArt/PlinthProject/CAMPStonewall.asp"/> (accessed <date value="2010-11-10"><date review=" -10-10">10 November 2010</date></date>).</p></note> Such a creative presentation of history, echoing the Gay Museum of Western Australia in its artistic origins, shows what can be done with the information at hand, and the existence of a public monument at all is a major advance. Yet as this article has shown, it is time now for <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> histories in Australia to take their due place not only out on the streets but also within the custodial powerhouses of our national narrative &#x2013; our museums, libraries and archives.</p>
<p>There still exists a level of scepticism among sections of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities towards the idea that larger institutions are becoming interested in unearthing, documenting and representing <hi rend="c">Lgbt</hi> history. Not without reason, many still harbour concerns that institutional support and initiation of these projects are a flash in the pan. The only mechanism available to allay these concerns is the conduct and completion of projects like the Survey, and the carrying out its recommendations. It is an opportunity for these institutions to rise to the challenge of sustained, ongoing and increasing commitment to truly broadening the scope and practices of cultural diversity. Museums, libraries and archives, as Richard Sandell puts it, must realise 'their potential to frame, inform and enable the conversations which visitors and society more broadly, have about difference'.<note xml:id="fn493-87" n="31"><p><hi rend="sup">31</hi>Richard Sandell, University of Leicester, School of Museum Studies homepage: <ptr target="http://www.le.ac.uk/ms/contactus/richardsandell.html"/> (accessed <date value="2010-07-14">14 July 2010</date>).</p></note> In order to meet this social potential museum management, government, and funding bodies must remember that where there is a will, there is a way. Our collecting and exhibiting institutions can be bold and can contribute to the struggle for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights, if they are prepared to take on the challenge and really achieve the 'honesty, accuracy, relevance and integrity' that is demanded of them.</p>

<p><hi rend="c">The Subject of Homosexual</hi> law reform was first raised in Victoria in <date value="1969">1969</date> when members of the Humanist Society and the Rationalist Society prompted public debate on the issue. The Humanist Society conducted a survey of 100 homosexual men and published <hi rend="i">The Homosexual and the Law</hi>, a pamphlet setting out the case for reform. When Society Five, Victoria's first openly organised homosexual group, was formed in <date value="1971">1971</date> it quickly established a sub-committee to look at the question of law reform. The committee succeeded in raising the profile of homosexuals' demands by writing letters to the press, speaking on radio, and sending speakers to a range of professional and community groups. The people who went public in those times did so at considerable risk, because the attitudes of many people were far from enlightened. Even heterosexuals who argued that the law should be changed risked being labelled as being homosexual, and any homosexual who dared to 'come out' faced the very real threat of losing their job and friends.</p>
<p>Society Five's law reform committee also developed a network of supportive contacts in political parties and churches and in the space of four years achieved considerable success. They managed to have motions of support for reform adopted by the policy-making bodies of the two major political parties in Victoria &#x2013; the Liberal Party State Council in <date value="1974">1974</date> and the Labor Party State Conference in <date value="1975">1975</date> &#x2013; and by the Synod of the Anglican Church in <date value="1971">1971</date>, the Presbyterian Church of Victoria's State General Assembly in <date value="1974">1974</date> and the Methodist Church of Australasia's General Conference in <date value="1972">1972</date>.</p>
<p>The first parliamentary move towards homosexual law reform in Victoria occurred when, in <date value="1975-10">October 1975</date>, Barry Jones, who was at that time a member of the Labor Opposition in the Victorian Parliament, introduced a private member's bill into parliament. Titled the <hi rend="i">Crimes (Sexual Behaviour) Bill <date value="1975">1975</date></hi>, the 'Jones Bill ' was only a partial reform because it only proposed to decriminalise those homosexual offences mentioned in the <hi rend="i">Crimes Act</hi>, i.e. buggery (anal intercourse) and gross indecency (which at that time in Victoria usually meant oral sex and/or masturbation). The bill did not propose removing the offences which were most commonly used against male homosexuals at that time, i.e. soliciting for homosexual purposes and loitering for homosexual purposes, both of which were in the <hi rend="i">Summary Offences Act</hi>. The bill also proposed an age of consent of 18 for sexual conduct between males, whereas the age of consent for equivalent heterosexual sexual conduct was 16. Although the bill was introduced into the Legislative Assembly, it was not debated and did not proceed beyond the first reading stage.</p>
<p>It was in <date value="1976">1976</date>, largely in response to the inadequacies of Barry Jones' bill and the general lack of interest shown by politicians in the issue of law reform, that homosexuals in Victoria began to lobby politicians in a more organised way. The Homosexual Law

the Opposition in the Legislative Council, introduced a Private Member's Bill that was in effect a second attempt by Barry Jones. The 'Jones/Galbally Bill' was an equality bill, based on the South Australian reform of <date value="1975">1975</date>. It proposed an equal age of consent, 16, and repeal of all specific homosexual offences in both the <hi rend="i">Crimes Act</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Summary Offences Act</hi>. The Jones/Galbally bill also contained provisions for a three-year differential age scale formula, which allowed a person of 14 or over to consent to sexual activity with a person not more than three years older than him or her &#x2013; effectively a means of legalising sex between young people of comparable age. This bill had a second reading in the Legislative Council on <date value="1977-03-23">23 March 1977</date>, but like its predecessor did not go any further.</p>
<p>In mid-<date value="1977">1977</date>, Haddon Storey met with a delegation from the <hi rend="c">Hlrc</hi> but indicated that he was not satisfied there was community support for the <hi rend="c">Hlrc</hi>'s proposal for equality between homosexual and heterosexual sexual conduct. Following its meeting with the Attorney-General, the <hi rend="c">Hlrc</hi> contacted Irving Saulwick, pollster for the <hi rend="i">Age</hi>, who agreed that when he next conducted a poll to test attitudes towards homosexual law reform, the question put would be whether people agreed or disagreed with the statement: 'sexual acts between persons of the same sex should be treated by law in the same way as sexual acts between persons of different sexes'. The results of the poll were published on <date value="1978-05-10"><date review=" -10-10">10 May 1978</date></date> and showed that 57% of those surveyed agreed with the statement, while only 30% disagreed. The <hi rend="c">Hlrc</hi> now had hard evidence to show that public opinion supported equality under the criminal law for homosexuals and that a change was needed.</p>
<p>Despite continued lobbying from the <hi rend="c">Hlrc</hi> and others, it was not until late <date value="1980">1980</date> that the Hamer Liberal Government introduced legislation to remove homosexual offences from the criminal law. In keeping with recommendations by the Premier's Equal Opportunity Advisory Council,<note xml:id="fn496-87" n="3"><p><hi rend="sup">3</hi>See 'Report of the Equal Opportunity Advisory Council to the Honourable R.J. Hamer, E.D., M.P., Premier of Victoria, The Decriminalisation of Consensual Homosexual Offences', undated, copy held by Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, Articles, monographs and pamphlets collection, item 880 (unpublished).</p></note> the bill had much in common with the South Australian legislation of <date value="1975">1975</date>, treating homosexual and heterosexual conduct equally. A common age of consent was adopted (18 years in general, with various exceptions), the offence of 'the abominable crime of buggery' was abolished, as were the summary offences of soliciting and loitering for homosexual purposes.</p>
<p>In an attempt to limit the extent of homosexual law reform, dissidents within the Liberal Party succeeded in having a last-minute amendment included in the act. This amendment created a new summary offence of 'soliciting for immoral sexual purposes'. Even with the inclusion of this amendment nine members of the Liberal Party still crossed the floor and voted against their own party's reform.<note xml:id="fn497-87" n="4"><p><hi rend="sup">4</hi>For a full account of the parliamentary debate on homosexual law reform in Victoria, see <hi rend="i">Hansard</hi>, <date value="1980-12-11"><date review=" -11-11">11 December 1980</date></date>, pp. 5010-5081 and <date value="1980-12-17">17 December 1980</date>, pp. 5468-5475 (for Lower House Debate) and <date value="1980-12-03">3 December 1980</date>, pp. 4090-4137 and <date value="1980-12-04">4 December 1980</date>, pp. 4259-4300 and <date value="1980-12-17">17 December 1980</date>, pp. 5468-5474 (for Upper House debate).

<p>The following is the transcript of an interview I conducted with Haddon Storey in <date value="2010">2010</date> about his role as Attorney-General during Victoria's homosexual law reform debate.</p>
<p>Q Firstly, Haddon, when you made the decision to go into politics that was at the end of the Bolte era and Henry Bolte was still Premier. Would you have regarded yourself as a social progressive at the time?</p>
<p>A I don't think I would have used that terminology. I would have regarded myself as a liberal because I guess the Liberal Party is really a fairly broad church and its got people you'd describe as hard line conservatives ranging all the way to others who are more progressive and I'd put myself sort of in the progressive end of the scale.</p>
<p>Q Henry Bolte himself was not interested in civil liberties very much or the environment or things like that and when you first went into politics he was still the Premier. Did you find that you were sort of waiting for him to go in order for the party to progress or the government to progress?</p>
<pb xml:id="n168" n="168"/>
<p>A Well, no. I just found it very interesting to observe him and the way in which he operated and I found I was a bit surprised actually at the extent to which he was prepared to listen to other points of view. You didn't get that impression from the public. That's the only way I'd known him previously but I found in the party room he'd listen to people's point of view and he was also, I thought, unexpectedly receptive of the future because he clearly nominated and preferred Dick Hamer to be his successor, knowing that Dick had a totally different world view than his own. My view was that he could see the world was changing and he'd done his bit and he'd been there for a long time. He was happy to let somebody else take over for the change.</p>
<p>Q So when you became Attorney-General in <date value="1976">1976</date> did you have a reform agenda that you wanted to implement?</p>
<p>A Yes. There were a number of areas of law reform I was interested in. It was basically law reform. I'd been on several Law Council committees looking at things like consumer credit, privacy and so on, so I had all of those on my mind. I didn't have an agenda as such. I didn't have a list of 'these are things that have to be done'. I think I was still regarding myself as learning and to the extent that when I became Attorney-General I was talking to the Secretary of the Law Department about some of the reforms that we should make and wondered who were the policy people of the Department &#x2013; [only] to discover there were no policy people in the Department. The Secretary would come up with ideas if the minister wanted some ideas on policy. So one of my first tasks was to go through the very laborious and difficult process of getting some sort of policy unit set up for the Department.</p>
<p>Q When it comes to social issues &#x2013; and we'll bring in homosexual reform here &#x2013; when you were appointed in '76 there would have been some publicity, the beginning of a public debate about the issue of homosexual law reform?</p>
<p>A Yes, it was the beginning of public debate about that and also a variety of things associated with sexual crimes, a lot of reform discussion about rape, prostitution. I can't tell you at what point we started to look at it [homosexuality] and I'm not sure how much the policy unit did in that field. I have forgotten whether it was as early as '76 or a bit later on that we started working on this.</p>
<p>Q What was your attitude to homosexuality say at the time you went into politics or when the public debate started to arise? Did you have a personal view?</p>
<p>A I think my personal view was that this was something that shouldn't be in the realm of the criminal law.</p>
<p>Q In conversations with colleagues you would have been able to gauge what the general mood of the party and particularly I suppose the Nationals given that you were sort of in coalition with them, did you realise that it would be a difficult issue to push?</p>
<p>A Well, it was the sort of issue where I had to work out how we were going to achieve
<pb xml:id="n169" n="169"/>
this. It wasn't just a matter of coming up with some legislation saying 'here it is, let's go ahead and do it'. It had to be strategically worked on.</p>
<p>Q How influential did you see yourself in the government at that time? You were Attorney-General, but did you have a fair bit of clout? Would people listen to you? Would they be influenced by you?</p>
<p>A At that stage they listened to me on anything to do with the law. I think I had a strong reputation about that, a good reputation about that, but I was the last person to be put into Cabinet so I was appointed by the Premier. I wasn't elected in the party room. In those days we had elections and then the Premier of the day would appoint the last couple of the ministers. At that stage it was still just after the Bolte era. There were many Bolte ministers still there. The majority of the party were people who'd been there under Bolte. It was pretty hard for new people to get in and so in '76 we had the party meeting after the election and we elected the first 16 or what ever it was. I have forgotten how many ministers there were in those days, it might have been 15 ministers, all the old guard, and then Hamer announced he was picking the last two.</p>
<p>Q After you'd been appointed did he indicate to you that he wanted you as new blood, and new views, more progressive &#x2013; did he indicate that this was what he wanted?</p>
<p>A Yes. Dick was a person who if he decided somebody was able to look after something he told them in general terms what he would expect of them.</p>
<p>So after the appointment, some time after the appointment, we had a chat about various things and I am not sure whether we mentioned homosexual law reform at that conversation or not but the perception was go ahead and do what you think.</p>
<p>Q Do whatever you had to do?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Can you remember when homosexual law reform started to be seriously discussed and you, even though you may not have articulated this, when you made a commitment of 'we're going to do this'? Can you remember when that occurred?</p>
<p>A Well it was in the <date value="1970">1970s</date> some time. I can't remember when it was.</p>
<p>Q So there was no one event or whatever that sort of . . .</p>
<p>A I don't think so, no.</p>
<p>Q In an interview that someone did with Dick Hamer in the early '90s I think it was, he said that in the lead up to the '76 election the Liberal party platform included equality for all citizens before the law and that he viewed that as eliminating discrimination on the grounds of sexual preference as well.</p>
<p>A To be honest, and I might be wrong about this, but thinking about it, I can't remember a specific legal policy or Attorney-General's policy that was put out for that <date value="1976">1976</date> election. There must have been something but it must have been pretty low key &#x2013; but I was generally aware of Dick Hamer's views on equal opportunity
<pb xml:id="n170" n="170"/>
and anti-discrimination and in fact I'd done some work on equal opportunity. I am thinking now, when was the legislation?</p>
<p>Q It was '77 that the Act was passed.</p>
<p>A It was '77, yes.</p>
<p>Q There was a committee set up, a council, the Equal Opportunity Advisory Council was setup in '76 and that recommended homosexual law reform as one of its recommendations.</p>
<p>A Why I was trying to remember that is because equal opportunity legislation was the Premier's legislation but I actually did it. I was responsible for the drafting of it and presentation of it for the Party and so on. It wasn't strictly the Attorney- General's role.</p>
<p>Q But you would have been liaising with Hamer on the content of it?</p>
<p>A Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>Q Around this time were you aware of the views of, say, rank and file members of the party and the local branches in relation to an issue like, say, discrimination generally but homosexual law reform specifically?</p>
<p>A What I do remember is my personal staff working on this as well as the Departmental people. Probably the personal staff did more than the Departmental people in a way, we looked at legislation everywhere, right around the world, and we obviously saw what had happened in South Australia and would have seen the Bills that Jones and Galbally had brought in. But I think what we decided was that we needed to formulate a set of principles here and not just look at amending one bit of something; but rather it was necessary to have a systemic approach, a holistic approach and we were certainly influenced by other legislation than just Australian legislation.</p>
<p>Q When you finally acted in <date value="1980">1980</date>, you incorporated that graduated age of consent which South Australia hadn't done and it was ground breaking, so that's consistent with what you said about a systemic approach to the whole thing.</p>
<p>A Yes, and also picking up the threads about rape law reform and prostitution up to a point.</p>
<p>Q Rape law reform, yes, changing the definition of rape and prostitution.</p>
<p>A And trying to get something that addressed any of those issues in as holistic fashion as possible.</p>
<p>Q Yes. During the mid-to late-70s there was a lot more public debate, and gay activism around law reform increased dramatically with the formation of the Homosexual Law Reform Coalition and there was a lot of publicity. I mean you may or may not remember there was a lot of publicity in relation to the police activity down at Black Rock and it was Operation Salamander which was a part of the summer offensive.</p>
<p>A I think I can remember something about that.</p>
<p>Q Well that certainly got the Age going and they were editorialising and so on and
<pb xml:id="n171" n="171"/>
not long after that we [a delegation from the <hi rend="c">Hlrc</hi>] came to see you. There was Jamie Gardiner and myself and one other member of the Coalition there and during the course of the meeting you were talking about how sympathetic you were to reforming the law and you were talking about an age of consent of 18. Our position was equality, but you said, look that's not on, it is just not achievable. I got the impression that you were contemplating introducing homosexual law reform with an age consent of 18.</p>
<p>A Yes. Well, I don't remember the issue of the age of consent but I think at that point I would have certainly been contemplating legislation, if I can steer it through the party room and through the Cabinet.</p>
<p>Q When you said that, when you were quite strong in your determination that 16 wasn't going to be acceptable, I said at the meeting, 'well that's not acceptable to us and if you try and do that we'll lobby against it actively'. And I'm just wondering whether that would have dampened your enthusiasm, and you would have thought, 'oh well, we'll just leave it'?</p>
<p>A Probably, not, no, I think if we were going . . . If we were going to do it we were going to do it.</p>
<p>Q Even if we were going to oppose it?</p>
<p>A Well, in the end I guess I was being driven by what I thought needed to be done. I mean it would have been certainly difficult to go to the party room and say, here we want this legislation but it going to be opposed by the people that initially asked for it.</p>
<p>As I told you, we spent a long time working on it within the Department, to come up with what we thought was the appropriate reform legislation that we thought was acceptable. And parallel with that I was working with my party committee because in those days every Minister had a committee within the parliamentary party that looked at legislation and reported to the party on the legislation. Quite often the pattern would be for the Minister to prepare the legislation, have Cabinet approve it, then take it to the party committee for them to report to the party. I can recall that I certainly wasn't going to leave it to that sort of chance, that I wanted to, and did work, with the party committee.</p>
<p>Q So you influenced the party committee, you sort of shepherded it through that process? You were able to answer any criticism as it arose and deal with it so you could move forward.</p>
<p>A It was very helpful, yes, and influential within the party room that the party committee was in favour of the Bill. It wasn't just another thing thrust on them by a Minister or the Cabinet. Actually I'm very pleased with that party committee because the people on it who you might of thought were strongly opposed to the legislation worked very diligently and they were open, prepared to have an open mind.</p>
<pb xml:id="n172" n="172"/>
<p>Q That's more than half the battle, isn't it?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Do you have any recollection in relation to yourself and Dick Hamer, were you both equally supportive of homosexual law reform or was one of you more . . .</p>
<p>A I wouldn't like to draw distinctions there.</p>
<p>Q So you think it was pretty much it was something that was consistent with both your objectives?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q I suppose when it comes to the National Party you always knew that you were going to have some problems there. How did you deal, what was your strategy for dealing with the National Party opposition?</p>
<p>A I am just trying to remember. I don't think we had a joint party committee. I don't think we had Nationals on the party committee but the major thing was to ensure that Cabinet supported the legislation. I mean once Cabinet supports it well, then the National Party ministers would support it.</p>
<p>Q Within Cabinet, yes. Was there a robust debate within the Cabinet then, particularly from the National Party ministers?</p>
<p>A Not that robust. I mean you had the Premier supporting it, me supporting it. The way legislation is dealt with is you approve legislation in principle and then you go off and prepare the legislation and then you bring it back to Cabinet. By the time it comes back to Cabinet it's more about the details of it because the principles have already been agreed. The principle has already been approved so the debate would have been over the principle. I don't think it was that hard. There were strong supporters in Cabinet, even if there were some who didn't support it.</p>
<p>Q Was there any talk about it being introduced as a Private Members Bill?</p>
<p>A No, it was sort of government policy. The Premier supported it, wanted it. So the government was committed to it. I mean, it wouldn't have got through if it had been a private members Bill anyhow.</p>
<p>Q Why not, because it was a conscience vote?</p>
<p>A Well, any vote is a conscience vote under the Liberal Party constitution. If any member's conscience doesn't allow them to support it [they can vote against it] . . . That's always been a principle that was accepted within the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>But if it had been a Private Members Bill, it wouldn't have gone on conscience, it would have just been whether people wanted to vote for it or not. You know so they might be influenced by their electorate. They might be influenced by a number of things, be more unpredictable.</p>
<p>Q So as a government Bill you were confident that you had the numbers?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<pb xml:id="n173" n="173"/>
<p>Q Now, right at the last minute when the Bill was going through there was an amendment because the Summary Offences Act was being changed and the soliciting and whatever, and loitering laws were being removed but a new offence [soliciting for immoral sexual purposes] was created. Was that just accepted because it was the last day of the sitting and it wouldn't have got through had that not been . . .</p>
<p>A Well, I think it was a compromise. It was something that happened in the Assembly. I was in the Council. So the Premier accepted it in the Assembly. In fact I am not even sure, it might have been a bit different in the Assembly. Whatever it was, it came up to the Council and we had some vigorous debates about it. Whatever we finished up with was sort of a compromise that the Premier was happy with.</p>
<p>Q Yes. I mean the difficulty was that the term immoral sexual purpose had never been defined.</p>
<p>A Well nobody knew what it meant obviously, yes.</p>
<p>Q But the Hansard made it very clear that the opponents expect, or the proponents of the amendments expected it to include homosexual conduct and so they thought that it would. But of course it caused chaos when it came to implementation and interpretation and you would have been well aware of that and you would have said, oh well, we'll just leave it to the courts to decide.</p>
<p>A Yes. Yes. I think I wouldn't have known what they were saying in the assembly. The other people that you're talking about would have said that. I don't know that anybody would have said that in the council. Yes, well, all I can say is it wasn't my preference.</p>
<p>Q Looking now at the end of your career, just making a leap for the moment, when you look back on your achievements as Attorney-General just as a member of parliament and of the Liberal Government of the time, does homosexual law reform rate as an achievement?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Where does it sit in terms of the achievements?</p>
<p>A It's one of the substantial achievements both in terms of its own value, it should have been done and also because of the difficulty.</p>
<p>Q Of achieving it, yes.</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Thank you very much, Haddon, it has been terrific.</p>
<p>A A pleasure, Graham.</p>

In Australian slang, 'camp' came to mean homosexual. This was different from in the <hi rend="c">Uk</hi> and North America, where, from <date value="1918">1918</date>, it generally meant ostentatiously and effeminately homosexual, or queeny. There, 'to camp' was to behave in the manner of an outrageous queen, or to flaunt one's homosexuality.</p>
<p>3 <hi rend="i">The Encyclopedia of Melbourne</hi> (see following note) and <ptr target="http://www.emelbourne.net.au"/> redresses this with three lesbian and gay-related entries, although its entry for the Hotel Australia does not mention its gay cultural histories.</p>
<p>4 There are some suggestions of a possible gay culture in oral history interviews done by the <hi rend="c">Alga</hi> but they are somewhat vague and inconclusive.</p>

<p>42 Gary Jaynes of <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>, email to Richard Peterson, <date value="2010-02-15">15 February 2010</date>, says that a few people have called it the Pink Sink in oral history interviews for <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>, including with Dennis O'Keefe and Barry McKay, but why green and yellow tiles should be referred to as 'pink,' remains a mystery. Also, 'Bill,' born <date value="1918">1918</date>, interview. Other Melbourne rough basement bars were also known as 'The Snakepit,' including those at the George, Fitzroy Street and the Hotel Esplanade, St Kilda, neither of which were gay.</p>

'Trade' in the <hi rend="c">Uk</hi>, invariably means prostitution, but in Australia, whilst it may mean that, it also means potentially attractive and available 'lower class' gay men. 'Beat' in Australia means a place, usually a public toilet, known for potential homosexual sexual encounters.</p>

<p>69 Russell Grant interview. Perhaps this refers to the Woolshed.</p>
<p>70 Gerald Mayhead, 'In which we're served'.</p>
<p>71 Probably named because that section of Little Collins Street between Elizabeth and Swanston had been named the Hub and closed to vehicular traffic for a couple of hours at lunch-time, possibly from about <date value="1970">1970</date>. The Hub Arcade still exists, opposite the rear of Australia on Collins.</p>
<p>72 Gary Jaynes, <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>, email to Richard Petersen, <date value="2010-02-15">15 February 2010</date>, says that a few people have called it that [in oral history interviews held by <hi rend="c">Alga</hi>], including Barry McKay. This contrasts with Russell Grant's comment earlier.</p>
<p>73 The thematic d&#x00E9;cor was so well done that I wondered if a Myer window dresser had been involved. I cannot recall ever visiting the Snakepit, or the Club Bar, but once I began visiting the Woolshed in <date value="1970">1970</date> and over the following three years until I left for overseas, I was picked up by more potential lovers in the Woolshed than anywhere else.</p>

<p>6 It would necessarily be a history of queer sexualities, and not gay and lesbian, because the range of activities, interventions and individuals involved in the anti-homophobic and anti-heterosexist work at the centre of such a history are not exhaustively and properly addressed by terms like 'gay', 'lesbian' or any other identitarian label. One example of this is the fact that some young people involved in queer youth groups eschew labels or identify as queer heterosexual 'allies'. This terminological volatility and definitional instability is an integral component to telling the history.</p>
